(a) ether; (b) alcohol. Both an alcohol and an ether contain an oxygen atom, but its two single bonds are attached to different atoms. In an ether, oxygen is attached to two different carbon atoms. In an alcohol, one of oxygen’s attachments is to a hydrogen.<br /> (c) aldehyde; (d) carboxylic acid. Each compound has the carbonyl group,<div class="image-clearfix"> <img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/10/h.png"></div>but the compounds differ in the atoms attached to the carbon of that group. In aldehydes, the carbonyl carbon is directly attached to an H; in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl carbon is attached to the O of an O—H group.</p>
