            <p class="blog">G&amp;W Machine Shop is evaluating the proposed acquisition of a new milling machine. The milling machine costs $150,000 and would cost another $12,000 to modify it for special use by the company. The milling machine has an estimated service life of five years, with a salvage value of $45,000. With this milling machine, the firm will be able to generate additional annual revenues of $175,000. However, it requires a specially trained operator to run the machine. This will entail $60,000 in annual labor, $20,000 in annual material expenses, and another $10,000 in annual overhead (power and utility) expenses. It also requires an investment in working capital in the amount of $25,000, which will be recovered in full at the end of year 5.<br /> The milling machine falls into the MACRS seven‐year class.

<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> We will employ the business convention that no signs (positive or negative) be used in preparing the income statement except in the situation where we have a negative taxable income or tax savings. In this situation, we will use () to denote a negative entry. However, in preparing the cashflow statement, we will observe explicitly the sign convention: A positive sign indicates a cash inflow; a negative sign, or (), indicates a cash outflow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We can approach the problem in two steps by using the format shown in Figure 10.9 to generate an income statement and then a cash‐flow statement. Table 10.1 summarizes the cash-flow statement associated with the milling machine project. The following notes explain the essential items in Table 10.1:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>• Revenue:</strong> The revenues and costs are uniform annual flows in years 1 through 5. Annual revenues do not have to be uniform.<br /> <strong>• Expenses (excluding depreciation):</strong> In our example, we assumed that the annual labor cost, materials cost, and overhead are all constant throughout the project period.<br /> <strong>• Depreciation calculation:</strong> In year 0 (that is, at present), we have an investment cost of $162,000 for the equipment. This cost will be depreciated in years 1 through 5. Since the equipment is held for only five years (shorter than the recovery period), the applicable depreciation amounts would be as follows:</p>
 <table width="256"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center" width="64"><strong>Period </strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="64"><strong>Dep. Rate (%) </strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="64"><strong>Dep. Amount </strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="64"><strong>Book Value</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>14.286%</td> <td>$23,143</td> <td>$138,857</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>24.490%</td> <td>$39,673</td> <td>$99,184</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>17.493%</td> <td>$28,338</td> <td>$70,845</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>12.495%</td> <td>$20,242</td> <td>$50,604</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>8.925%</p>
 <hr /> </td> <td>$7,229</td> <td>$43,375</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>2</td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p style="padding-left: 40px">Note that the fifth‐year depreciation would ordinarily be $14,458 but is halved due to the half‐year convention. We now have a value for our unknown <span class="tex-text">\(D_{n}\)</span>, which will enable us to complete the cell entries from C10 to G10.<br /> <strong>• Taxable income:</strong> Once we find depreciation allowances for each year, we can easily compute the results for years 1 through 5, which have fixed revenue and expense entries, including the variable depreciation charges.<br /> <strong>• Salvage value and gains tax:</strong> In year 5, we must deal with two aspects of the asset’s disposal: salvage value and taxable gains. We list the estimated salvage value as a positive cash flow. Taxable gains are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 80px"><strong>1.</strong> The total depreciation in years 1 through 5 is $118,625.<br /> <strong>2.</strong> The book value at the end of year 5 is the cost basis minus the total depreciation, or $162,000 &#8211; $118,625 = $43,375.<br /> <strong>3.</strong> The taxable gains on the sale are the salvage value minus the book value, or $45,000 &#8211; $43,375 = $1,625. (The salvage value is less than the cost basis, so these gains are ordinary gains.)<br /> <strong>4.</strong> The tax on the ordinary gains is $1,625 <span class="tex-text">\(\times \)</span> 40% = $650.<br /> This is the amount placed in the table in cell G24.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>• Working capital:</strong> The investment in working capital is shown in cell B25, and its recovery appears in cell G25. As mentioned earlier, there are no tax consequences on the recovery amount even though it is a positive cash inflow.<br /> <strong>• Investment analysis:</strong> Once we obtain the project’s net cash flows after‐tax, we can determine their equivalent present worth at the firm’s discount rate. Since this series does not contain any patterns to simplify our calculations, we must find the net present worth of each payment. Using i = 15%, we have</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;text-align: center">PW(15%) = -$187,000 + $60,257(P/F, 15%, 1) + $66,869(P/F, 15%, 2) + $62,335(P/F, 15%, 3) + $59,097(P/F, 15%, 4) + $123,242(P/F, 15%, 5)<br /> = $52,008.</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px">This result means that investing $187,000 in the milling machine project would bring in enough revenues to recover the initial investment and the cost of funds with a surplus of $52,008. Clearly, this is a good project to undertake.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> There is an alternative way of preparing the cash flow statement. A tabular format widely used in traditional engineering economics texts is shown in Table 10.2 . Unlike the income‐statement approach shown in Table 10.1 , you may skip the entire process of computing the net income, thereby computing income taxes directly. However, most firms prepare the cash‐flow statement according to a format similar to Table 10.1 , as they want to know both net income as well as cashflow figures. Therefore, we will use the cash‐flow statement format from Table 10. whenever possible throughout this text.</p>
