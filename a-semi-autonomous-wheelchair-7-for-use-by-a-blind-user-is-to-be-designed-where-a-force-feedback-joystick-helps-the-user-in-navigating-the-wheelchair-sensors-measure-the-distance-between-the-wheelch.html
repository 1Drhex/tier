Notice how this is in fact very similar to an autonomous robot, except that the user provides the final actuating decision based on the resistance he or she feels at the joystick. Based on the preceding discussion, we follow the next three steps to design the system. The MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Designer Toolbox was used for the following simulation:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) <em>Fuzzification</em>. In this part we develop the fuzzy sets relating to the two inputs and the output. We assume that the range of distances in which we are interested is 0–10 ft, the desired range of speed is 0–5 fps, and the resistance varies between 0–100%. Figure 12.8 demonstrates the three fuzzy sets for the two inputs and one output. We select four fuzzy sets FAR, CLOSE, NEAR, and ADJACENT to express distances, and three fuzzy sets SLOW, FAST, and VERY-FAST to express speeds. The output resistance provided to the joystick is divided into five fuzzy sets of LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY-HIGH, and FULL. Notice that there are gaps between some fuzzy sets’ limits. Obviously, we could have chosen other ranges for each membership function, divided the ranges differently, decided on different ranges of overlap for the functions, or assigned asymmetrical membership functions. This, as in all design activities, is based on the requirements of the system and the experience of the designer. However, we will study the response of the system later and, if necessary, will make adjustments.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) <em>Development of the rules</em>. Since there are four membership functions for distance and three membership functions for speed, there will be a total of 4 × 3 = 12 rules. Table 12.1 and Figure 12.9 show the symbolic and graphical representations of the rules. Notice that in each rule (or control law), one membership function for every input is considered. The consequence for each rule is chosen based</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Table 12.1</strong> Symbolic representation of the rules from Example 12.1</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 516px" width="358"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="75">1) If (Distance is FAR) and (Speed is SLOW) then (Resistance is LOW)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2) If (Distance is FAR) and (Speed is FAST) then (Resistance is LOW)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3) If (Distance is FAR) and (Speed is VERY-FAST) then (Resistance is MEDIUM)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4) If (Distance is CLOSE) and (Speed is SLOW) then (Resistance is LOW)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5) If (Distance is CLOSE) and (Speed is FAST) then (Resistance is MEDIUM)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6) If (Distance is CLOSE) and (Speed is VERY-FAST) then (Resistance is HIGH)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7) If (Distance is NEAR) and (Speed is SLOW) then (Resistance is MEDIUM)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8) If (Distance is NEAR) and (Speed is FAST) then (Resistance is HIGH)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9) If (Distance is NEAR) and (Speed is VERY-FAST) then (Resistance is VERY-HIGH)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10) If (Distance is ADJACENT) and (Speed is SLOW) then (Resistance is VERY-HIGH)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11) If (Distance is ADJACENT) and (Speed is FAST) then (Resistance is FULL)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12) If (Distance is ADJACENT) and (Speed is VERY-FAST) then (Resistance is FULL)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
on the experience of the designer and the necessities of the design. For example, in Rule 1, if distance is FAR and speed is SLOW, the consequence (resistance at the joystick), based on experience and the desired result of the rule, is chosen as LOW. However, in Rule 11, the consequence for ADJACENT and FAST is FULL in order to help the user immediately stop the wheelchair. We cannot truly guess the consequence yet, until the system is simulated and the response is checked. If the output is not as desired, the rules (or membership functions) may be adjusted until a satisfactory result is obtained. Also notice that some of the rules could have been based on “or” instead of “and.”</p>
 <p class="blog">
To understand how the results are found, let’s look at some numbers. Suppose the present distance is 4.3 ft and speed is 2.75 fps. As shown in Figure 12.8, the resulting membership values will be 0.65 NEAR, 0.2 CLOSE, and 0.75 FAST. All other membership values are zero.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting these values into the corresponding rules (also shown graphically in Figure 12.9) yields output membership values of 0.2 MEDIUM and 0.65 HIGH. Remember that since we are using “and” logic, the minimum value between the two numbers is selected. So, for example, in Rule 5, the smaller of 0.75 and 0.2 is chosen.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) <em>Defuzzification.</em> Now that we have found the output membership values, we have to defuzzify these values to get a crisp power setting for the system. We calculate the output value based on both the center of gravity method and the Mamdani inference method. For the center of gravity method, we multiply the output membership values by their corresponding singleton values and then divide by the sum of the membership values to get:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Power = \frac{0.2\times 30/100+0.65\times 50/100}{0.2+0.65} = 45\)</span>%</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the Mamdani inference method, we first truncate the MEDIUM and HIGH functions at 0.2 and 0.65 values, combine the two into a single area, and calculate the center of gravity of the resulting area, as shown in Figure 12.10.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The center of gravity of the resulting area can be calculated by taking the first moment of the area and dividing it by the total area, and is calculated to be approximately at 55%, which is somewhat different from the center of gravity method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will continue with this example later as we simulate and improve the system.</p>
