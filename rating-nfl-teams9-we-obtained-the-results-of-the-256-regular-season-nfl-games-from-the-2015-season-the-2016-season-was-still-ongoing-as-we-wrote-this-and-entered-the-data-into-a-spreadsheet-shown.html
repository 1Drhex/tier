New England won the game by a score of 28 to 21, and the point spread (home team score minus visitor team score) is calculated in column J.

We first need to explain the methodology used to rate teams. (See Figure 7.39 and the file NFL Ratings Big Picture.xlsx.) Suppose that a team plays at home against another team. Then the prediction for the point spread of the game (home team score minus visitor team score) is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Predicted point spread= Home team rating &#8211; Visitor team rating 1 Home team advantage</p>
 <p class="blog">
The home team advantage is the number of points extra for the home team because of the psychological (or physical) advantage of playing on its home field. Football experts claim that this home team advantage in the NFL is about three points. However, the model will estimate it, as well as the ratings.<br /> The prediction error is defined as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Prediction error = Actual point spread &#8211; Predicted point spread</p>
 <p class="blog">
The model determines ratings that minimize the sum of squared prediction errors<span class="tex-text">\(.^{10}\)</span> To get a unique answer to the problem, the ratings must be normalizedâ€”that is, the average rating must be fixed at some nominal value. Because the well-known Sagarin ratings use a nominal value in the mid-80s, a nominal value of 85 is used here. (Any nominal value could be used to produce exactly the same relative ratings.) Then what do ratings of, say, 82 and 91 really mean? They mean that if two teams with these ratings play each other on a neutral field, the higher rated team is predicted to win by 9 points.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> To produce the model in Figure 7.38, proceed as follows:<br /> 1) Input game data. If you want to determine the ratings for another NFL (or NBA or MLB) season, you have to get the data from the Web. (We are fortunate to have an inside contactâ€”Winstonâ€™s best friend is Jeff Sagarin.)<br /> 2) Decision variable cells. Enter any value for the home field advantage and the 32 team ratings in the Home_team_advantage and Rating ranges. These are the decision variable cells. Note that it would be possible to use a given value for the home team advantage, such as 3, but the model will let Solver choose the home team advantage that best fits the data.<br /> 3) Average rating. Enter the nominal average rating in cell B43, and average the ratings in cell B41 with the formula<br /> =AVERAGE(Rating)<br /> 4) Actual point spreads. Enter the actual point spreads in column J as differences between columns H and I.<br /> 5) Predictions. The data on games played refer to the team index numbers. This allows you to use lookup functions to predict the point spreads. To do this, enter the formula =Home_team_advantage+VLOOKUP(F6,RatingTable,3)-<br /> VLOOKUP(G6,RatingTable,3) in cell K6 for the first game, and copy it down column K for the rest of the games. The VLOOKUP functions simply look up the ratings of the home and visiting teams. (The range name RatingTable refers to the range A5:C36.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Prediction errors. The objective is to minimize the sum of squared prediction errors. Therefore, enter the formula<br /> =(J6-K6)^2<br /> in cell L6, and copy it down. Then sum the squared errors in cell F2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The completed Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 7.40. The objective is to find the ratings and home field advantage that minimize the sum of squared prediction errors. The only constraint is to make the ratings average to the nominal rating. Because of the squared errors, this is a nonlinear model, so the GRG Nonlinear method should be used. Also, there is no need to check the Non-Negative option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 7.38 shows that a home team advantage of 1.56 provides the best fit, at least for the 2015 season. To provide a better picture of the ratings, the teams are sorted from best to worst in Figure 7.41. You might recall that Denver beat Carolina in the Super Bowl. The ratings ranked these teams near the top, but not at the top, with Carolina a slight favorite (based on regular-season games only). The ratings support the playoff picture fairly well. The 12 playoff teams are shown with color shading. Most of the highly rated teams made the playoffs. (The two lowest-ranked teams to make the playoffs, Houston and Washington, both lost in the first round.) Of course, the NFL has its own way of deciding which teams make the playoffs. It doesnâ€™t just go according to the Sagarin ratings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Remember that the actual values of the ratings are not as important as the differences between teamsâ€™ ratings. For example, if Pittsburgh plays Baltimore at Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh is predicted to win by 1.56 + (93.70 2 83.06) â‰ˆ12.2 points. Of course, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in any game. Although Pittsburgh is predicted to win by 12.2 points, the actual outcome could be much different<span class="tex-text">\(.^{11}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. This model does not capture the effect of intangibles, such as injuries to key players. If you were going to bet real money on NFL games, you might start with the ratings from the model and then modify them in a subjective fashion to capture any inside knowledge you have.<br /> 2. The future predictive accuracy can be improved by giving more weight to more recent games. To do this, you could multiply the squared error for a game k weeks ago by a factor such as <span class="tex-text">\((0.95)^{k}\)</span>. As an indication of how this discounts the importance of past games, this weighting gives a game from five weeks ago about 77% of the weight given to this weekâ€™s game.<br /> 3. Solver could also be used to find the set of ratings that minimizes the sum of absolute prediction errors. This shouldnâ€™t have much effect on the relative rankings.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
9:The procedure used in this example is practically identical to the procedure used by the nationally syndicated Jeff Sagarin to rate various sports teams. You can see his ratings at www.usatoday.com/sports/sagarin.htm.</p>
 <p class="blog">
10:Why squared errors? Admittedly, you could minimize the sum of the absolute prediction errors, but minimizing the sum of squared errors has a long tradition in statistics.</p>
 <p class="blog">
11:If you were going to simulate NFL games based on these ratings, you would simulate a normally distributed point spread with the mean equal to the predicted point spread and standard deviation equal to about 14 points, a value that has been estimated from a lot of historical data. Yes, there is this much variability in NFL games.</p>
