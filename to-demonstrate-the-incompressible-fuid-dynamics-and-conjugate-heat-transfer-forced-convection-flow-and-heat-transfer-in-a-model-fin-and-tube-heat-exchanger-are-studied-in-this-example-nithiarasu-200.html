            <p class="blog">To demonstrate the incompressible fuid dynamics and conjugate heat transfer, forced convection flow and heat transfer in a model fin and tube heat exchanger are studied in this example (Nithiarasu 2008). Due to the low memory needs and easy implementation, the fully explicit solution algorithm is chosen here (see Chapter 7) (Nithiarasu 2003). The comparison of speed between the fully explicit method with local time stepping against other implicit methods shows that the explicit method is robust and in some cases outperforms the other methods (Codina et al. 2006; Massarotti et al. 2006).</p>

Figure 9.11 shows a partial representation of a fin and tube heat exchanger model. The fins are attached to the solid wall of the heat exchanger as shown in the figure. The outside solid surface is assumed to be at a higher temperature than the air at the inlet to the heat exchanger. Thus, the heat is expected to transfer through the solid wall and then dissipated to the fluid via the inside solid wall surface and the fin surfaces. The fuid side, bottom and top boundaries are subjected to zero flux boundary conditions. The inlet velocity is assumed to be constant and uniform. To demonstrate the method, an inlet Reynolds number of 200 and thermal conductivity ratio between the solid and fuid of 10 are assumed.The first step in the numerical modeling is generating a finite element mesh. We use the simplest of all type of elements, tetrahedral elements, to discretize the domain. Since unstructured meshing can be automated, we use a linear unstructured mesh. First, a surface mesh is generated by defining different curves and surfaces of the geometry. Once a surface mesh is available, a volume mesh is generated by filling the spaces between surfaces using tetrahedrons. In the present case, the solid fins should also be meshed. More details on the meshing methods is available in Chapter 14. Figure 9.12 shows the unstructured surface mesh used in the calculations. The mesh is generated using the meshing tools available within Swansea, Collage of Engineering (Morgan et al. 1999). As seen, the mesh is refined close to the solid-fuid interface to have smooth change in the temperature distribution. The total number of tetrahedron elements used is just over 1.7 million.Once the mesh is generated, the solid and fluid elements should be labeled using appropriate material codes. In two-dimensional problems, the regions can be easily identified for allocating material codes. In three-dimensional problems, however, a special and automatic procedure may be used. This procedure is simple to implement. The procedure starts with zero material code for all the nodes in a domain, except the surfaces surrounding the domain(s) as shown in Figure 9.13. Once zero has been allocated to all the inside nodes, change the material code of the partitioning surface between two domains to anumber, say 2, as shown in Figure 9.13. All the nodes on nonpartitioning surfaces should be labeled with the material code that would be given to the nodes inside the domain (1 in Figure 9.13). Now, check the nodes connected to the surface nodes labeled with 1 and if the nodes connected have a zero material code, replace it with 1. Continue checking until all the zero material codes are replaced with</p>
 <ol> <li>Note that this process of checking will stop automatically as soon as the process reaches the surface nodes with label 2 . This should be continued for all the different subdomains until all the nodes are labeled with appropriate material codes. Figure 9.14 shows contours of the material codes. As seen, the procedure outlined here easily identifies the solid and fluid domains with different material codes. Often the interface conditions between the fluid and solid needs to be addressed before obtaining a solution. At the interface, both the temperature and fux should be continuous. Since a linear approximation for the temperature is assumed throughout the domain, temperature continuity across the interface is ensured. However, the heat flux is not continuous across the interface. Special conditions may be applied to ensure flux continuity. However, such treatment needs a solution to additional variables. The alternative is to approximate fux continuity by introducing finer mesh along the interface. For the heat exchanger problem solved here, the interface is treated using the latter approach.</li> </ol> <p class="blog">

Figures 9.15 to 9.17 show the results obtained. In Figure 9.15, the surface contours of pressure, velocity components and temperature are presented. As seen, the contours are generally smooth, including the pressure contours. In Figure 9.16 the temperature distribution at different sections, along the length <span class="tex-text">\( \left(x_{1}\right. \)</span> direction) of the heat exchanger, is presented. As seen, the transition of the temperature from solid to fuid is smooth without any noticeable discontinuity.Figure 9.17(a) shows the temperature distribution in the <span class="tex-text">\( x_{2}\)</span> direction along the lines at the middle of the fins and Figure 9.17(b) shows the temperature distribution at <span class="tex-text">\( x_{2}=0.523\)</span> along the <span class="tex-text">\( x_{3}\)</span> direction. Figures 9.17(c) and (d) show the temperature distributions along <span class="tex-text">\( x_{2}\)</span> direction, at sections <span class="tex-text">\( x_{3}=0.407\)</span> and 1.064 respectively. As seen, a majority of the solid wall portions show a linear variation of temperature. In the fluid region, including fins, the temperature variation is nonlinear. It is also noticed that the no heat flux conditions at the fluid side boundary is effectively captured. In Figures 9.17( c ) and (d), a rapid change in temperature is clearly shown at the interface. In addition, the average temperature at section <span class="tex-text">\( x_{1}=2\)</span> is much lower than at section <span class="tex-text">\( x_{1}=14\)</span> as expected. All the results shown in Figure 9.17 are consistent with the qualitative solution exp</p>
