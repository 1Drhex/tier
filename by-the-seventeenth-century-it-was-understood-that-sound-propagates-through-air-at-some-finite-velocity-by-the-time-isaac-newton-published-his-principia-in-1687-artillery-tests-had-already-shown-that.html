            <p class="blog">By the seventeenth century it was understood that sound propagates through air at some finite velocity. By the time Isaac Newton published his Principia in 1687, artillery tests had already shown that the sea-level speed of sound was approximately 1140 ft/s. Comparing that result with today’s knowledge of the standard speed of sound at sea level, namely 1117 ft/s, shows that these early seventeenth century measurements were remarkably accurate. Armed with this experimental result for the speed of sound, Isaac Newton in his Principia made the first calculation of the speed of sound (see Reference 58). Here Newton correctly theorized that the speed of sound was related to the “elasticity” of the air, which is the reciprocal of the compressibility, τ . However, he incorrectly assumed that the changes of properties in a sound wave took place isothermally. Using Newton’s assumption of isothermal changes through the sound wave, calculate the value obtained by Newton for sea-level speed of sound.</p>

The isothermal compressibility is defined as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{T}=-\frac{1}{v}\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial p}\right)_{T}(7.34)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From the equation of state, v = RT/p. Thus</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial p}\right)_{T}=-\frac{R T}{p^{2}}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting this result into Equation (7.34), we have</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{T}=-\frac{1}{v}\left(-\frac{R T}{p^{2}}\right)=\frac{R T}{(p v) p}=\frac{R T}{(R T)_{p}}=\frac{1}{p} (E8.5)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Using this isothermal value for the compressibility in Equation (8.27) rather than thecorrect isentropic compressibility, we have (incorrectly)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(a=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho \tau_{s}}} (8.27)\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(a_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho \tau_{T}}} \quad \text { (Newton&#039;s incorrect result) } (E8.6)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
At standard sea level, <span class="tex-text">\(p = 2116 lb/ft^{2}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(ρ = 0.002377 slug/ft^{3}\)</span>. Hence, the calculation of the speed of sound assuming isothermal conditions through the sound wave is, from Equations (E8.5) and (E8.6),</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(a_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\rho \tau_{T}}}=\sqrt{\frac{p}{\rho}}=\sqrt{\frac{2116}{0.002377}}=943.5 ft / s\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Isaac Newton reported in his Principia a value of 979 ft/s for the speed of sound, about 4 percent higher than the value calculated in this example. The difference is most likely due to the rather imprecise values for sea-level atmospheric properties known in Newton’s time. Note: The isentropic compressibility is given by</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{s}=\frac{1}{\gamma p} (E8.4)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The isothermal compressibility is given by</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{T}=\frac{1}{p} (E8.5)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The two values differ by the factor γ . The speed of sound calculated from the isothermal compressibility will be smaller than that calculated from the isentropic compressibility by the factor<span class="tex-text">\((\gamma)^{-1 / 2}\)</span>, or by 0.845. The isothermal calculation will yield a speed of sound about 15 percent lower than the correct value. It is interesting that Newton’s calculated value of the speed of sound, as reported in his Principia, was about 15 percent lower than the measured value at that time of 1140 ft/s. Undaunted, Newton tried to explain away the differences as due to the presence of dust particles and water vapor in the atmosphere. Finally, a century later the French mathematician Laplace corrected Newton’s error by correctly assuming that a sound wave was adiabatic, not isothermal. Therefore, by Napoleon’s time in the 1820s, the process and relationship for the propagation of sound in a gas were fully understood.</p>
