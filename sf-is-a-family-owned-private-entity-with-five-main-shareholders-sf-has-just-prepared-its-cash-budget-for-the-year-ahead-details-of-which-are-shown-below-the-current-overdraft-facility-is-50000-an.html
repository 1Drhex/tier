To: The Board, SF<br /> From: Consultant<br /> Re: Review of cash budget<br /> I have reviewed the cash budget for the year. The closing balance of cash at the bank is $50,000 lower than at the beginning of the year. Between August and November the deficit is in excess of the overdraft facility that the bank is willing to make available. The following actions might be considered to improve the budgeted cash flow for the year.<br /> (a) Trade receivables. SF could attempt to improve the collection period from trade receivables. The normal credit period for the industry is not known, but the existing average credit period of two months does not seem excessive. A selective tightening of credit control (including collection) procedures might be possible. Offering cash discounts might speed up some collections, but could prove an expensive method of improving cash flow. Factoring of debts would be another possibility. The cost of the factoring service will be offset in part by savings from the outsourcing of the credit control and sales ledger departments and potential savings in bad debts.<br /> (b) Investment. The amount invested must be significant, given a dividend receivable of $10,000. It might be possible to dispose of part of this investment. Assuming a return on the investment of 5 per cent, the investment itself may be worth as much as $200,000. Such action should be taken only if all other possibilities have failed, as this action would remove the opportunity to benefit from the long-term growth of the investment. The nature of the investment is also important, as it may have strategic business links.<br /> (c) Payables. The entity is already taking up to 90 days’ credit, so the scope for delaying payments to payables further must be limited. It might be possible to take temporary longer credit from selected suppliers by arrangement. The build-up of inventory should be investigated; it may be in anticipation of a future increase in sales. The business is seasonal, and there may be scope for altering the production pattern. This in turn may lead to changes in the payment pattern for materials, wages and other operating expenses.<br /> (d) Wages and salaries. While not suggesting any actions to improve cash flow, it should be recognised that, if wages are paid weekly, the overdraft at the end of the month understates the maximum position. For instance, the overdraft of $94,000 at the end of October will continue to rise by three weekly wage payments before any cash is received from customers at the end of November. This assumes that customer receipts are not spread over the month. In this case, it would help if employees could be persuaded to move to a monthly payment basis.<br /> (e) Payments for non-current assets. It may be possible to delay or cancel the purchase of office furniture if it is considered non-essential, although the amount is relatively small and so will have little impact on the cash-flow problems. The progress payment on the building extension is likely to be a commitment that cannot be avoided. The purchase of the car could perhaps be deferred if it is a replacement, as it may not be essential at the time scheduled. The new equipment should be investigated to establish whether it is an essential replacement, or whether it is perhaps in anticipation of an expansion of the business; however, delaying payment by one or two months would not alter the forecast overdraft position. If the equipment must be replaced, consideration may be given to leasing, which would ease the cash-flow problems.<br /> (f) Dividend. The payment of the dividend may be forgone, which will significantly help the cash-flow problems. It is recognised, however, that the dividend may be an important source of income to some of the shareholders. Alternatively, there may be scope to delay payment of the dividend.<br /> (g) Taxation. Corporation tax would be payable nine months after the entity’s year end. It would be possible to defer payment, subject to agreement from the revenue authorities. There would be an interest charge, but it might be lower than the bank’s interest charge.<br /> (h) Long-term capital. It appears that no new equity investment is being made to cover the proposed capital expenditure. Consideration should therefore be given urgently by the directors to increasing the permanent capital of SF. If the existing shareholders are unable, or unwilling, to provide additional finance, the directors could explore the possibility of attracting new shareholders. External equity may be provided by a venture capital provider, or a ‘business angel’. This would possibly involve the new equity providers taking a substantial stake in the business. The budgeted income statement and balance sheet have not been provided, but the income tax bill of $30,000 would suggest a reasonably profitable business that should help to attract investors.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Additional points<br /> ● It should also be recognised that the cash budget does not allow for the interest charged on the overdraft by the bank, which itself will increase the overdraft balance, and will usually be applied each quarter.<br /> ● SF’s cash balance could potentially be improved by investing cash surpluses identified in the early part of the year for the short term. The possible opportunities may be restricted by the amount of surplus cash available and the length of time the cash is available, but may include bank deposits, gilts close to redemption and bills of exchange.<br /> Signed: Consultant</p>
