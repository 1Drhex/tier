            <p class="blog">Gerry is an entry-level engineer at Boeing Aerospace in California. He took a financial risk and bought a bond from a different corporation that had defaulted on its interest payments. He paid $4240 for an 8% $10,000 bond with interest payable quarterly. The bond paid no interest for the first 3 years after Gerry bought it. If interest was paid for the next 7 years, and then Gerry was able to resell the bond for $11,000, what rate of return did he make on the investment? Assume the bond is scheduled to mature 18 years after he bought it. Perform hand and computer analysis.</p>

Solution by Hand<br /> The bond interest received in years 4 through 10 was</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(I=\frac{(10,000)(0.08)} {4}=\$200\)</span> per quarter</p>
 <p class="blog">
The effective rate of return per quarter can be determined by solving the PW equation developed on a per quarter basis, since this basis makes PP = CP.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(0 = &#8211; 4240 + 200(P/A,i^{*} per \ quarter,28)(P/ F,i^{*} per \ quarter,12) +11,000(P / F,i^{*} per \ quarter,40)\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">The equation is correct for <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*} = 4.1 \%\)</span> per quarter, which is a nominal 16.4% per year, compounded quarterly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solution by Computer<br /> The solution is shown in Figure 7-11. The spreadsheet is set up to directly calculate an annual interest rate of 16.41 % in cell E1. The quarterly bond interest receipts of $200 are converted to equivalent annual receipts of $724.24 using the PV function in cell E6. A quarterly rate could be determined initially on the spreadsheet, but this approach would require four times as many entries of $200 each, compared to the six times $724.24 is entered here. (A circular reference may be indicated by Excel between cells E1, E6, and B6. However, clicking on OK will override and the solution <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*} = 16.41\%\)</span> is displayed. A circular reference is avoided if all 40 quarters of $0 and $200 are entered in column B with necessary changes in the column E relations to find the quarterly rate.)</p>
