From the diagram, the budgeted cost of all the project work is the following: Activity A = $18K, B = $10K, C = $20K, D = $40K. This is the cost of each activity when they are 100% completed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The project is currently at day X, and so from the diagram, 100% of activity A should be completed, and it is; 100% of activity B should be completed, but only 80% is; 80% of activity C should be completed, but only 70% is; and 15% of activity D should be completed, but it has not started.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 1</strong>: Calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) given the current state of the project. This is the value or cost of the project that is expected, given the project is at time X:<br /> Activity A 100% of $18K = $18K<br /> Activity B 100% of $10K = $10K<br /> Activity C 80% of $20K = $16K<br /> Activity D 15% of $40K = $6K<br /> BCWS = $18K + $10K + $16K + $6K = $50K</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Calculate the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) given the current state of the project. This is the actual value or cost of the project to date, given the project is at time X:<br /> Activity A 100% of $18K = $18K<br /> Activity B 80% of $10K = $8K<br /> Activity C 70% of $20K = $14K<br /> Activity D 0% of $40K = $0<br /> BCWP = $18K + $8K + $14K + $0K = $40K</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Obtain the Actual Cost (AC) of the work performed. This would need to be obtained from accounting records for the project. Assume that the AC for this project to date is $45K.<br /> AC = $45K (Data from Acct. System)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 4</strong>: Calculate key performance measures for the project:<br /> Schedule Variance: This is the difference between the Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) and the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) for the project:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Schedule Variance = BCWP – BCWS<br /> Schedule Variance = $40K – $50K = –$10K<br /> Greater than 0 is generally good because it implies the project is ahead of schedule.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Schedule Performance Index: This is the ratio of the BCWP versus the BCWS for the project:<br /> Schedule Performance Index = BCWP/BCWS<br /> Schedule Performance Index = $40K /$50K = 0.8<br /> Greater than 1 is generally good because it implies the project is ahead of schedule.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Cost Variance: This is the difference between BCWP and the Actual Cost (AC):<br /> Cost Variance = BCWP – AC<br /> Cost Variance = $40K – $45K = –$5K<br /> Greater than 0 is generally good because it implies under budget.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Cost Performance Index: This is the ratio of the BCWP versus the AC for the project to date:<br /> Cost Performance Index = BCWP/AC<br /> Cost Performance Index = $40K/$45K = 0.89<br /> &lt; 1 means the cost of completing the work is higher than planned, which is bad.<br /> = 1 means the cost of completing the work is right on plan, which is good.<br /> &gt; 1 means the cost of completing the work is lower than planned, which is usually good.</p>
 <p class="blog">
That CPI means the project is spending about $1.13 for every $1.00 of budgeted work accomplished. This is not very good because the project is overbudget and tasks are not being completed on time or on budget. A Schedule Performance Index and a Cost Performance Index greater than 1 are desirable.</p>
