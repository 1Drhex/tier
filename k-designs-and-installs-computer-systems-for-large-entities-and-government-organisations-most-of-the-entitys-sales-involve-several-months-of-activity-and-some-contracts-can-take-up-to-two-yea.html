(a) Construction contracts are frequently entered into by businesses such as shipbuilders, construction engineers and other similar industries, where contracts normally last for a period of more than one year. Because of the length of time such contracts take to complete, to defer taking profit into account until completion would result in the income statement not reflecting a true and fair view of activities of the entity during the year. Instead, the accounts would only show the results of those contracts that happened to be completed by the year end. As a result, it is normal accounting practice that, where a contract spans more than one accounting period, a proportion of profit is taken during the life of the contract, rather than waiting and taking the whole profit on completion.<br /> In the past, the accounting treatment of construction contracts varied enormously from entity to entity. IAS 2 attempts to reduce the amount of variation between entities in their choice of accounting treatment, although directors are still left with a certain amount of latitude in deciding which approach to take. In particular, IAS 2 allows flexibility in the choice of how to apportion costs and revenue between the years of the contract. Various methods of determining the degree of completion of the contract are allowed by the standard. Permissible methods include:<br /> ● taking the proportion that contract costs incurred for work to date bear to estimated total contract costs;<br /> ● surveys of work performed;<br /> ● completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.<br /> Even if all entities were to use the same method, they would still need to incorporate figures which are estimated. Because accounting forecasts and estimates are often highly subjective, this can also lead to inconsistencies between entities.<br /> The standard attempts to counteract these problems to some extent, by requiring a fair amount of disclosure, such as explanation of the means by which sales revenue has been determined.<br /> (b) There are three accounting standards which relate directly to why the entity should assume that Contract B will be sold for only $4m, even though there is a strong possibility that the entity will obtain a higher amount.<br /> ● First, IAS 1 outlines the fundamental accounting concepts, one of which is prudence. This requires that revenue and profits should not be anticipated, but should be included in the accounts only when realised.<br /> ● This position is further underlined by IAS 37, which requires that contingent gains or revenues should not be included in accounts, because they are dependent on an uncertain future event (in this case, the resolution of the contract negotiations).<br /> ● Finally, IAS 2 requires that profit on long-term contracts is calculated in a prudent manner. If K were to take the selling price as the higher figure of $4.8m, this could not be considered to be prudent, and the directors would therefore not be complying with the terms or the spirit of the standard.<br /> (c) Inventories should be included in the financial statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and the fact is that the workstations had a net realisable value of only $120,000. When entities are valuing year-end inventories, they should use all available information to arrive at an amount. That will often include information which only becomes available after the year end, such as in this case. The situation is similar to the requirement to write off a bad debt at the year end, even though the customer only went into liquidation after the year end. IAS 10 specifically identifies evidence concerning the net realisable value of inventories as being an adjusting event after the balance sheet date. This means that the amount previously included in the financial statements should be changed to the lower amount.</p>
