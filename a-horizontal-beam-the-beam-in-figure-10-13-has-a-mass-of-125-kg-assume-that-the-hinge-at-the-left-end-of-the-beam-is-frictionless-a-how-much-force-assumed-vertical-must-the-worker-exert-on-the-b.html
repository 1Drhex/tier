(a) We start by drawing the FBD of the beam. The FBD in Figure 10-14 shows three forces acting on the beam: the force of gravity at the centre of gravity of the beam, the applied vertical force exerted by the worker at the right end, and the support force exerted by the hinge at the left end. We will use <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x} \text { and } A_{y}\)</span> to represent the horizontal and vertical components of the support force exerted by the hinge on the beam at A and we will assume that they point along the directions shown in the FBD. We note that since we are treating these as components of a force, rather than forces, you will see that, here and elsewhere, the symbols for these components will not be shown with an arrow on top, unlike other forces in the FBD. (In some texts, and in engineering applications, you might see components treated as two separate forces rather than as components of the same force. We note here that it is also common to refer to the support force at the hinge as the reaction force at the hinge. Occasionally it is also referred to as the hinge force.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the beam to be in equilibrium, the sum of the forces and the torques acting on the beam must be zero. Summing the forces in the x-direction gives</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\sum F_{x}=A_{x}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
and we immediately find that <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x}=0\)</span>. We still have two unknowns: the vertical component of the support force exerted by the hinge on the beam, <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span>, and the force <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ F }\)</span> exerted by the worker.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will first try applying the condition for equilibrium for forces in the y-direction:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum F_{y}=0\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Choosing up as our positive y-direction, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F-M g+A_{y}=0\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
We have two unknowns in this equation. We note that although this equation must be satisfied for the beam to be in equilibrium, it does not give us either of the unknown forces. We have deliberately chosen to begin with the sum of the forces in the y-direction to illustrate that although the equation is valid and needed, this is not the most efficient choice for a first step. We would like, whenever possible, to begin with an equation that yields one of the unknowns immediately.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We have not yet applied the equilibrium condition for torques acting on the beam. If the worker let go of the beam, it would rotate about the hinge. The force exerted by the worker prevents the beam from swinging. Summing the torques about the hinge at A gives</p>
 <p class="blog">

<span class="tex-text">\(\sum \vec{\tau}=\vec{\tau}_{M g}+\vec{\tau}_{F}=0\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
From Figure 10-14, the components of the support force of the hinge on the beam exert no torque about the hinge because their moment arms (the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the force) are zero. So we only consider the torques due to the force of gravity and the force exerted by the worker. Taking clockwise to be positive, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\curvearrowright+\sum \tau_{ A }=\tau_{M g}-\tau_{F}=0\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
From Equation 8-20, we know that the torque due to a force about a pivot equals the product of the force and the perpendicular distance (the moment arm) between the force and the pivot. Therefore,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\tau=(r \sin \theta) F=r_{\perp} F\)</span> {8-20}</p>

&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(M g\left(\frac{L}{2}\right)-F(L)=0\)</span> <p class="blog">

<span class="tex-text">\(\Rightarrow F=\frac{M g}{2}=\frac{(125 kg )\left(9.81 m / s ^{2}\right)}{2}=613 N\)</span> (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Substituting the expression for F from (5) into (2) gives</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{M g}{2}-M g+A_{y}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">

It is interesting to note that the torque equation immediately yields one of the unknown quantities; the force exerted by the worker on the beam. This is because we were able to eliminate the components of the support force of the hinge on the beam as unknowns in the torque equation by taking the sum of the torques about the hinge. The support force of the hinge on the beam exerts no torque about the hinge, therefore its components do not appear in the torque equation. As we shall see in the alternative solution below, we can use this to our advantage.</p>

 <p class="blog">
The second condition for equilibrium, Equation 10-2, states that the sum of the torques about any point must be zero. Summing the torques about a pivot or hinge is often the simplest approach. However, we can sum the torques about any other convenient point.</p>

Let us consider the torques about the end of the beam that the worker is holding. The worker exerts no torque at this end of the beam because the moment arm of the force exerted by the worker on the beam is zero. The forces exerting torques about this point are the force of gravity on the beam and the component <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span>. The horizontal component of the support force at the hinge exerts no torque about the worker end of the beam, point B, as its moment arm is zero (its line of action goes through the point). Therefore,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\sum \overrightarrow{ \tau }_{ B }=\overrightarrow{ \tau }_{M g}+\overrightarrow{ \tau }_{A_{v}}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">

Taking counter-clockwise to be positive, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\curvearrowleft+\sum \tau_{ B }=\tau_{M g}-\tau_{A_{y}}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Taking the torque to be the product of the force and the moment arm, we have</p>

In the FBD of Figure 10-14 we assumed that <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span> points up. Since the value we got for <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span> is positive, this indicates that our assumption or guess regarding its direction is correct. We mention this point here briefly and elaborate on it later in the chapter.</p>

<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the worker and the hinge both apply forces that are equidistant from the centre of gravity, it is not too surprising that the forces they apply are equal. This becomes very clear if we sum the torques about the centre of gravity. Both forces exert equal torques in opposite directions with equal moment arms, so the forces must be equal.</p>
