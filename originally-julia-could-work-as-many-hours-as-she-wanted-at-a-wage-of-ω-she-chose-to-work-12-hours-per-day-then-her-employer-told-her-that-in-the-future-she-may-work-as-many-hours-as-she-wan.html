The figure shows Julia’s original consumer equilibrium: Originally, Julia’s budget constraint was a straight line, <span class="tex-text">\(L^{1}\)</span> with a slope of -ω, which was tangent to her indifference curve <span class="tex-text">\(I^{1}\)</span> at <span class="tex-text">\(e_{1}\)</span>, so she worked 12 hours a day and consumed <span class="tex-text">\(Y_{1}\)</span>= 12ω goods. The maximum-hours restriction creates a kink in Julia’s new budget constraint, <span class="tex-text">\(L^{2}\)</span>. This constraint is the same as <span class="tex-text">\(L^{1}\)</span>up to eight hours of work, and is horizontal at Y = 8ω for more hours of work. The highest indifference curve that touches this constraint is <span class="tex-text">\(I^{2}\)</span>. Because of the restriction on the hours she can work, Julia chooses to work eight hours a day and to consume <span class="tex-text">\(Y_{2}\)</span>= 8ω goods, at <span class="tex-text">\(e_{2}\)</span>. (She will not choose to work fewer than eight hours. For her to do so, her indifference curve <span class="tex-text">\(I^{2} \)</span>would have to be tangent to the downward-sloping section of the new budget constraint. However, such an indifference curve would have to cross the original indifference curve, <span class="tex-text">\(I^{1}\)</span>, which is impossible: see Chapter 3.) Thus, forcing Julia to restrict her hours lowers her utility: <span class="tex-text">\(I^{2}\)</span> must be below <span class="tex-text">\(I^{1}\)</span>.</p>

<strong>Comment:</strong> When I was in college, I was offered a summer job in California. My employer said, “You’re lucky you’re a male.” He claimed that, to protect women (and children) from overwork, an archaic law required him to pay women, but not men, double overtime after eight hours of work. As a result, he offered overtime work only to his male employees. Such clearly discriminatory rules and behavior are now prohibited. Today, however, both females and males must be paid higher overtime wages—typically 1.5 times as much as the usual wage. Consequently, many employers do not let employees work overtime.</p>
