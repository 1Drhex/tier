As discussed earlier, there are many nondimensional parameters involved in a double-diffusive natural convection problem. They are Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, Lewis number and Buoyancy ratio. Only small number of parameters are considered here to demonstrate the finite element solver. The problem solved here is very similar to the natural convection solved in Chapter 7 . The difference here is that the additional variable of concentration is also solved. The problem domain consists of a closed rectangular cavity with rigid walls. All the walls are subjected to no slip velocity boundary conditions. The top and bottom walls are assumed to have zero heat and mass fux entering or exiting the domain. The left-side vertical wall is assumed to be at a higher temperature and concentration than that of the right-side vertical wall. Figure 10.11(a) shows the complete problem definition. For the sake of simplicity, the Prandtl number is fixed as 0.72 and Lewis number is assumed to be unity in the first case studied. The aspect ratio of the first case studied is unity (square cavity). The finite element meshes used are shown in Figure 10.11(b)and (c) Figure 10.12 shows the velocity vectors and contours of concentration distribution at different buoyancy ratios. The temperature contours are identical to that of the concentration contours and thus they are not presented here. Only one Rayleigh number solution is presented here to demonstrate the problem. The Rayleigh number selected is <span class="tex-text">\( 10^{5} . \)</span> Figure 10.12(a) shows the results at a buoyancy ratio of unity. This means the effect of Rayleigh number doubles and results in a combined Rayleigh number of <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \times 10^{5} . \)</span> As seen, the flow pattern is close to the natural convective flow at a Rayleigh number of <span class="tex-text">\( 10^{5}\)</span>, given in Chapter 7 . As the buoyancy ratio is increased to 3 as shown in Figure 10.12(b), the combined Rayleigh number increases to <span class="tex-text">\( 4 \times 10^{5}\)</span> and the effect on flow, concentration and temperature distributions are very similar to the effect of increase in Rayleigh number discussed in Chapter 7 . As the buoyancy ratio is reduced to -1, the thermal and solutal buoyancies cancel each other and the temperature and concentration transport will be through pure diffusion. Reduction of B below -1 will result in a net negative buoyancy value in the upward direction and the flow direction reverses as shown in Figure 10.12(c) at B =-5. At this B value, a combined Rayleigh number value of <span class="tex-text">\( -4 \times 10^{5}\)</span> is obtained and results in a solution that is a mirror image of the solution at B=3 as shown in Figures 10.12(b) and (c) . Figure 10.13 shows the average Sherwood number distribution at a Rayleigh number of <span class="tex-text">\( 10^{5}\)</span> at different buoyancy ratios. The Nusselt number distribution is identical to the distribution shown and thus not plotted separately. The Sherwood numbers calculated on both meshes are plotted to show the effect of number of points. The mesh1 has a small number of points compared to mesh2. Due to the small number of nodes and the orientation of triangles, the average Sherwood number distribution is slightly unsymmetric with respect B=-1 .When the number of points are increased, as in mesh2, the birdseye view distribution of the average Sherwood number as shown in Figure 10.13 is more or less symmetric. The birdseye view distribution is typical in such applications.</p>
