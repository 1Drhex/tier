The forces acting on the wedge are its weight <span class="tex-text">\( mg \)</span> and a force <span class="tex-text">\( K,\)</span> perpendicular to the inclined plane; the magnitude of the latter may change with time. As a result of these two forces, the only component of the wedge&#8217;s acceleration a parallel to the inclined plane is <span class="tex-text">\( g \sin α \)</span> (as measured in an inertial frame). Newton&#8217;s equations of motion remain valid in an accelerating frame of reference fixed to the wedge only if an &#8216;inertial force&#8217; <span class="tex-text">\( -m^′a \)</span> is added to the forces actually causing the motion of a body. Here <span class="tex-text">\( m^′ \)</span> is the mass of the body under examination (e.g. that of a small volume of water).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resultant of the gravitational and inertial forces acting on the mass <span class="tex-text">\( m^′ \)</span> must be perpendicular to the inclined plane as the components parallel to it cancel each other. The bodies on the wedge (the glass and the water in it) &#8216;feel&#8217; as if they were in a gravitational field perpendicular to the inclined plane, with the consequence that the surface of the water lies parallel to the plane.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This statement does not depend on the motion of the plane; it can be fixed or move freely or even- as the result of a small force- be shaken to and fro. As long as the friction between the inclined plane and the wedge is negligible and the wedge does not rise off the plane, the shape of the water surface cannot be other than a plane parallel to the inclined surface.<br /> The case <span class="tex-text">\( m \gg M \)</span> deserves an additional comment. In this case, the wedge &#8216;pushes away&#8217; the inclined plane, and falls nearly freely. The weight of the bodies on the wedge (including the water) are nearly completely &#8216;lost&#8217;; but even so, the small force keeping the water inside the glass is still sufficient to set the water surface parallel to the inclined plane.<br /> <em>Note</em>. The water surface would only become parallel to the inclined plane after a long time, and on a correspondingly long plane. This is why this interesting phenomenon cannot be observed experimentally in normal circumstances.</p>
