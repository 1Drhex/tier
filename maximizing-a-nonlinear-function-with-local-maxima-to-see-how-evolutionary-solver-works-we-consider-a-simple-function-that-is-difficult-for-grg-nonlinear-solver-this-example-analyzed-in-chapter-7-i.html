            <p class="blog">Maximizing a Nonlinear Function with Local Maxima<br /> To see how Evolutionary Solver works, we consider a simple function that is difficult for GRG Nonlinear Solver. This example, analyzed in Chapter 7, is a function of a single variable x: f(x) = (x &#8211; 1)(x &#8211; 2)(x &#8211; 3)(x &#8211; 4)(x &#8211; 5) for 1 ≤ x ≤ 5. The objective is to maximize f(x) over this range. However, the graph of this function shown in Figure 8.2 indicates that there are two local maxima: one at around x 5=3.5 and the other at x = 5. The global maximum, the one we want, is near x = 1.5. Can Evolutionary Solver find this global maximum?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To illustrate how Evolutionary Solver works and to see how it can successfully find a global maximum for a function with several local maxima.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/8.2-1.png"></div>

The model is particularly simple. (See Figure 8.3 and the file Local Maxima.xlsx.) To set it up, enter any value in cell B5 (the only decision variable cell), enter the formula =B5-1 in cell B6, copy this down to cell B10, and enter the formula =PRODUCT(B6:B10) in cell B11. The objective is to maximize the value in cell B11 while constraining the value in cell B5 to be between 1 and 5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If GRG Nonlinear Solver is used, the solution depends on the starting value in cell B6. If this starting point is near 5, the Solver solution is 5, corresponding to the local maximum at x = 5. If the starting point is near 3.5, then the Solver solution is 3.54, corresponding to the local maximum at x = 3.54. Only if the starting point is sufficiently small does Solver correctly find the global maximum at x = 1.356. If you didn’t have a graph of the function to lead you in the right direction, how would you know where to start? The Multistart option discussed in the previous chapter is perfect for this type of problem with multiple local maxima, but you can also use Evolutionary Solver, as discussed next.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> Evolutionary Solver uses GAs to obtain “good” solutions. It begins with a population containing, say, 100 sets of values—chromosomes—for the decision variable cells. For example, one chromosome might be 3.778. (This would be coded in binary form by the algorithm.) This chromosome represents the value of x in this example, but it generally represents a set of values in the decision variable cells. Chromosomes that yield large objective values have more chance of surviving to the next generation of chromosomes. Chromosomes that yield small objective values have little chance of surviving to the next generation. Occasionally, Evolutionary Solver drastically changes—mutates—the value of a decision variable cell. You usually stop Evolutionary Solver after a specified time period (such as one minute) or when there has been no improvement in the objective cell value for a given amount of time. Here is some general information about Evolutionary Solver:</p>
 <p class="blog">
■■ Evolutionary Solver usually finds a good solution, but there is no guarantee that it will find the best solution.<br /> ■■ Evolutionary Solver is not very efficient at handling constraints. The best way to handle constraints is to penalize a violation of a constraint. This is done by including a numeric penalty as part of the objective. Penalties are not used in this example, but they are illustrated later in the chapter.<br /> ■■ A good starting solution—the values you place in the decision variable cells—usually helps Evolutionary Solver in its search for an optimal solution. However, the starting solution is not absolutely critical to success.<br /> ■■ Evolutionary Solver places more of a burden on you to specify certain parameters of the algorithm. These parameters are specified in the Options dialog box, as will be illustrated shortly. Unfortunately, these parameters are not very intuitive to most users, and some experimentation is necessary to find the best settings of these parameters for any given model. Nevertheless, if you use the default settings or the settings we suggest, they should work reasonably well.<br /> ■■ Much of the solution process is driven by random numbers that direct the search. Therefore, two people can get different solutions to the same problem. In fact, running Evolutionary Solver a second time can possibly yield a different solution. You can set a random seed parameter to ensure the same solution on two successive runs.<br /> ■■ Optionally, after Evolutionary Solver has found a good solution, you can use GRG Nonlinear Solver to try to find a slightly better solution. If there is no improvement, you can probably infer that the solution found by Evolutionary Solver is optimal or close to optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In general, use the following steps to implement Evolutionary Solver:<br /> 1) Open Solver. Open Solver in the usual way, from the Data ribbon.<br /> 2) Specify the objective cell, decision variable cells, and constraints. Do this in the usual way. The only difference is that you should put lower and upper bounds on all decision variable cells—in addition to any other constraints that might be in the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Select Evolutionary Solver. Click the drop-down list of available algorithms to select Evolutionary Solver (see Figure 8.4). This is the option used throughout this chapter, but you can also experiment with GRG Nonlinear Solver, especially after Evolutionary Solver finds a good solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4)Solver Options. Click the Options button and then the All Methods tab to see the dialog box in Figure 8.5. The bottom section of this dialog box, relevant for all Solver algorithms, allows you to enter some Solving Limits such as the ones shown. The main reason for doing so is to keep Evolutionary Solver from repeatedly beeping at you as it reaches these limits.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, select the Evolutionary tab to see the dialog box in Figure 8.6. These are the settings that control Evolutionary Solver. The following information about them is available in online help.<br /> ■■ Convergence measures the rate of change of the objective. You can leave this at its default value.<br /> ■■ Mutation rate governs the frequency at which mutations are introduced into the population of solutions. Mutations shouldn’t be introduced too often, but by introducing them every now and then, the GA has a chance to explore a completely different area of the feasible region. You can leave this setting at its default value (0.075), but we<br /> have sometimes had success by increasing it to 0.25.<br /> ■■ Population size is the number of candidate solutions (chromosomes) at any point in time, and the default value of 100 should work well, although we sometimes increase it to 150. Note that the initial population is chosen randomly, but it includes at least one instance of the starting solution you specify in the decision variable cells.<br /> ■■ Evolutionary Solver uses a random mechanism to perform its search, but you can make it go through exactly the same calculations on two separate runs if you use the same random seed (any integer) on each run. You can leave this box blank, in which case Evolutionary Solver bases the seed on the system clock (which makes it seem random).<br /> ■■ You should check the Require Bounds on Variables option. This forces you to enter explicit upper and lower bounds on all decision variable cells, which aids Evolutionary Solver in its search process.<br /> ■■ Maximum Time without Improvement (measured in seconds) indicates the stopping rule for the algorithm. If it doesn’t find a “meaningful” improvement in this amount of time, it will stop and report the best solution so far.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Solve. Go back to the main Solver dialog box and click Solve. You can watch the progress of the solution process in the status bar of your screen. In particular, watch the incumbent, which is the current best value of the objective cell. Typically, this value decreases (for a minimization problem) rapidly at first, and then very slowly. If you sense that it is going nowhere after a minute or two (and you are tired of waiting), you can press the Esc key a few times to stop the process. (Don’t be impatient. Evolutionary Solver tends to keep running for a while even after you press Esc.) From there, you can either let the process continue or accept the best solution to this point. Don’t be surprised if the solution process takes much longer than you have experienced for Solver models in previous chapters. GAs are not guaranteed to be fast, but they make up for it by being more flexible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For this particular model, Evolutionary Solver gets to the solution shown earlier in Figure 8.2 almost instantaneously. Then it runs for 30 seconds (the time specified in the dialog box in Figure 8.6) without being able to find a better solution, at which time it quits. Note that this solution is indeed the global optimal solution (refer to Figure 8.2), and Evolutionary Solver finds it almost immediately, even when starting at a solution, such as 3.5 or 4.9, that is close to a local maximum. This is because Evolutionary Solver looks all over the feasible region for potentially good solutions. Therefore, Evolutionary Solver is not as likely to get stuck at a local optimum as GRG Nonlinear Solver.</p>
