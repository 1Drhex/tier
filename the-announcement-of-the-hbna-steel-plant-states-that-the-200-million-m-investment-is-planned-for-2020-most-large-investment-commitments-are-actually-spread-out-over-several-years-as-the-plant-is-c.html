            <p class="blog">The announcement of the HBNA steel plant states that the $200 million (M) investment is planned for 2020. Most large investment commitments are actually spread out over several years as the plant is constructed and production is initiated. Further investigation may determine, for example, that the $200 M is a present worth in the year 2020 of anticipated investments during the next 4 years (2021 through 2024). Assume the amount planned for 2021 is $100 M with constant decreases of $25 M each year thereafter. As before, assume the time value of money for investment capital is 10% per year to answer the following questions using tabulated factors and spreadsheet functions, as requested below.</p> <p class="blog">a) In equivalent present worth values, does the planned decreasing investment series equal the announced $200 M in 2020? Use both tabulated factors and spreadsheet functions.<br /> (b) Given the planned investment series, what is the equivalent annual amount that will be invested from 2021 to 2024? Use both tabulated factors and spreadsheet functions.<br /> (c) (This optional question introduces<strong> Excel’s Goal Seek tool.</strong>) What must be the amount of yearly constant decrease through 2024 to have a present worth of exactly $200 M in 2020, provided $100 M is expended in 2021? Use a spreadsheet.</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p>

(a) The investment series is a decreasing arithmetic gradient with a base amount of $100 M in year 1 (2021) and G = $−25 M through year 4 (2024). Figure 2–18 diagrams the cash flows with the shaded area showing the constantly declining investment each year. The <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span> value at time 0 at 10% per year is determined by using tables and a spreadsheet.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Tabulated factors</em>: Equation [2.19]<span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }= P_{A } ± P_{G }\)</span> with the minus sign for negative gradients determines the total present worth <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span>. Money is expressed in $1 million units</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }= P_{A } − P_{G }\)</span> = 100(P∕A,10%,4) − 25(P∕G,10%,4)= 100(3.1699) – 25(4.3781)<br /> = $207.537 ($207,537,000)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In present worth terms, the planned series will exceed the equivalent of $200 M in 2020 by approximately $7.5 M.<br /> <em>Spreadsheet</em>: Since there is no spreadsheet function to directly display present worth for a gradient series, enter the cash flows in a sequence of cells (rows or columns) and use the NPV function to find present worth. Figure 2–19 shows the entries and function NPV(i%,second_cell:last_cell). There is no first_cell entry here because there is no investment per se in year 0.The result displayed in cell C9, $207.534, is the total <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span> for the planned series. (Note that the NPV function does not consider two separate series of cash flows as is necessary when using tabulated factors.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The interpretation is the same as in part (a); the planned investment series exceeds the $200 M in present worth terms by approximately $7.5 M.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b)<em>Tabulated factors</em>: There are two equally correct ways to find <span class="tex-text">\(A_{T }\)</span>. First, apply Equation [2.20] <span class="tex-text">\(A_{T }= A_{A }±A_{G }\)</span>that utilizes the A∕G factor, and second, use the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span> value obtained above and the A∕P factor. Both relations are illustrated here, in $1 million units.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Use Equation [2.20]:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A_{T }\)</span> = 100 – 25(A∕G,10%,4) = 100 − 25(1.3812)<br /> = $65.471 per year ($65,471,000)</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Use <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span>:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A_{T }\)</span> = 207.537(A∕P,10%,4) = 207.537(0.31547)<br /> = $65.471 per year</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><em>Spreadsheet</em>: Apply the PMT function in Equation [2.29 ] PMT(i%, n, cell_with_PG) to obtain the same <span class="tex-text">\(A_{T }\)</span> = $65.471 per year (Figure 2–19).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) (Optional) The <strong>Goal Seek tool</strong> is described in Appendix A. It is an excellent tool to apply when one cell entry must equal a specific value and only one other cell can change. This is the case here; the NPV function (cell C9 in Figure 2–19) must equal $200, and the gradient G (cell C1) is unknown. This is the same as stating <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }\)</span> = 200 in Equation [2.30] <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T }= P_{A } − P_{G }\)</span> = 100(P∕A,10%,4) − 25(P∕G,10%,4) and solving for G. All other parameters retain their current value.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 2–20 (top) pictures the same spreadsheet used previously with the Goal Seek template added and loaded. When OK is clicked, the solution is displayed; G = $−26.721. Refer to Figure 2–20 again. This means that if the investment is decreased by a constant annual amount of $26.721 M, the equivalent total present worth invested over the 4 years will be exactly $200 M.</p>
