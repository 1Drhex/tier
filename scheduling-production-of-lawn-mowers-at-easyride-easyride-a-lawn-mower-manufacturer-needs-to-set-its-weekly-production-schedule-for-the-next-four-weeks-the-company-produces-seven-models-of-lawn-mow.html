            <p class="blog">Scheduling Production of Lawn Mowers at Easyride<br /> EasyRide, a lawn mower manufacturer, needs to set its weekly production schedule for the next four weeks. The company produces seven models of lawn mowers. At the beginning of each month, the company has reasonably accurate forecasts for the demand of each model for the month. It also has forecasts for the portion of this demand from customers who will drive to the plant to pick up their lawn mowers. The company has four competing objectives regarding its production schedule.<br /> ■■ Avoid costly model changeovers during each week as much as possible.<br /> ■■ Come as close as possible to producing the mowers demanded by customers during week 1 (assuming the “pickup” customers, those who drive to the plant to pick up their mowers, typically arrive during week 1).<br /> ■■ Keep weekly production hours as constant as possible across weeks at each of the three machining centers that the mowers go through.<br /> ■■ Come as close as possible to producing as many mowers of each model as its monthly forecasts require.<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To use Evolutionary Solver to find a production schedule that achieves the company’s goals as fully as possible.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> As in other production scheduling models we have discussed, the most crucial inputs are the demand forecasts. The company presumably has a method for forecasting demands, probably based on historical data and orders already on the books.</p>

The variables for this model are shown in Figure 8.16. (See the file Lawnmower Production Big Picture.xlsx.) It is typically not possible to satisfy all of EasyRide’s objectives. Therefore, you can think of the objectives as targets. If any solution falls short of the target, it is penalized—the farther from the target, the larger the penalty. This is an especially useful technique when using Evolutionary Solver, which thrives on messy objective functions but does less well with a lot of constraints. Therefore, instead of using constraints, the deviations from targets are penalized, and the objective to minimize is the total of the penalties.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The data for the problem appear in Figure 8.17 (see the file Lawnmower Production. xlsx). Rows 5 and 6 indicate the forecasts of customer pickups and monthly totals, and rows 10 through 12 indicate the number of hours required at each machine center to produce a mower of each model. The unit penalty costs in rows 15 to 18 are not really “givens.” (To indicate this in Figure 8.16, the Unit penalty costs shape is colored a lighter shade of blue.) They must be estimated by EasyRide to reflect trade-offs among the competing objectives. They imply the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
■■ A changeover penalty of 200 is incurred for each model produced at any positive level during a week. For example, if 3 models are produced the first week, 4 the second, 3 the<br /> third, and 5 the fourth, the total changeover penalty is (3 + 4 + 3 + 5)(200) = 3000.<br /> ■■ A pickup shortage penalty of 50 is incurred for each unit of pickup demand not satisfied during week 1. For example, if 20 units of model 1 are produced during week 1, the pickup penalty for this model is (10)(50) = 500 because 20 is 10 short of the required 30.<br /> ■■ A smoothing production penalty of 1 is incurred during each week at each machine center per hour of deviation from the required weekly average at that center. Here, the required weekly average is based on the production levels needed to meet monthly forecasts. Their implementation will be explained shortly.<br /> ■■ A meeting monthly forecasts penalty of 10 is incurred per unit of each model produced above or below the monthly forecast. For example, if the total monthly production of model 1 is 105 or 115 (a deviation of 5 below or 5 above the monthly forecast), the penalty in either case is (5)(10) 5 50.<br /> Again, these unit penalties are not givens, and they must be chosen carefully by EasyRide, perhaps on the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Clearly, if one unit penalty is too large, its corresponding objective tends to dominate the solution. In the same way, if a unit penalty is too small, its corresponding objective is practically ignored. We have tried to choose unit penalties that produce a reasonable solution, but you might want to experiment with others.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed model appears in Figure 8.18 and in the file Lawnmower Production Finished.xlsx. It can be developed with the following steps:<br /> 1) Production schedule. The decision variables are the weekly production levels of each model. Enter any values for these in the Production range. (Refer to Figure 8.17 for range names used.)<br /> 2) Models produced. To calculate the number of different models produced each week (which are needed for the model changeover objective), enter the formula<br /> =COUNTIF(B22:H22,&#8221;&gt;0&#8243;)<br /> in cell I22 and copy it down.<br /> 3) Deviations from forecasts. To calculate the total monthy production levels for each model and see how much they deviate from the monthly forecasts, enter the formulas<br /> =SUM(B22:B25)<br /> and<br /> =ABS(B6-B26)<br /> in cells B26 and B27 for model 1, and copy these across for the other models. (Recall that ABS is Excel’s absolute value function.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Pickup shortages. To see how much week 1 production of each model is short (if any) of the pickup demand, enter the formula<br /> =IF(B22&lt;B5,B5-B22,0)<br /> in cell B28 and copy it across.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Hourly smoothing. This is the trickiest objective. The production hours at each machine center should remain as constant as possible across weeks. Although there are undoubtedly other ways to implement this, we suggest the following approach. First, calculate the weekly average hours required at each machine center if the company produces exactly enough in the month to meet monthly forecasts. To do this, enter the formula =SUMPRODUCT($B$6:$H$6,B10:H10)/4<br /> in cell B31 for center 1 and copy it down for the other two centers. (Note that division by 4 is used to obtain a weekly average.) These weekly averages become the targets. Next, calculate the actual hours used at each center each week in the range B37:E39. Unfortunately, there is no way to enter a single formula and then copy it to the rest of the range. However, you can try the following. Enter the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT($B$22:$H$22,$B10:$H10)<br /> in cell B37 and copy it down to cell B39. Then copy the range B37:B39 to the range C37:E39. The resulting formulas for weeks 2 to 4 in columns C to E will not be quite correct,<br /> but you can modify them easily. Specifically, change each 22 in the column C formulas to 23, to 24 in column D, and to 25 in column E. The point is that when copying is not possible, sometimes copying a formula and then modifying it is easier than entering new formulas from scratch. Finally, calculate the deviations from targets in the range H37:K39 by entering the formula<br /> =ABS(B37-$B31)<br /> in cell H37 and copying it to the rest of the range. (Here, copying is possible.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Penalties. Calculate the various penalties in the range B42:B45 with the formulas<br /> =B15*SUM(122:125)<br /> =B16*SUM(B28:H28)<br /> =B17*SUM(H37:K39)<br /> and<br /> =B18*SUM(B27:H27)<br /> Then calculate the total penalty as their sum in cell B46.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup for this model appears in Figure 8.19. The objective is to minimize the total of penalties, the decision variable cells are the production levels, and there are no constraints other than lower and upper bounds and integer constraints on the production levels. As for the upper bounds, 150 is fairly arbitrary. The largest monthly forecast for any model is 115, but the company might want production to exceed this forecast. Therefore, you can build in some “padding” with the upper limit of 150.</p>
 <p class="blog">
After some experimenting, you will see that this is a difficult problem even for Evolutionary Solver. Depending on the starting solution, it can take some time to find as good a solution as the one in Figure 8.18. Therefore, it helps to enter large values in the Solver Options dialog boxes for Max Time, Max Subproblems, Max Feasible Solutions, and Maximum Time without Improvement (this latter setting under the Evolutionary tab). Otherwise, Evolutionary Solver might quit prematurely at a solution far from optimal. Another possible strategy is to drop the integer constraint by checking the box in Figure 8.20. This will find a “good” noninteger solution relatively quickly. Then you can run the Solver again with the box unchecked, starting from this noninteger solution, to find a good integer solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 8.18 represents the best compromise we could find. It produces all seven models during week 1 to keep the pickup shortages low. In fact, it has no pickup shortages. After that, it produces only three separate models each week to keep the changeover penalties low. This solution produces exactly to the monthly forecasts. Finally, all of this is done in a way to keep the production hours as constant as possible across weeks. Even so, the chart in Figure 8.18, based on the data in the range B37:E39, shows that the production hours still vary to some extent across weeks at each machine center. Of course, if you change the unit penalties to reflect different priorities on the objectives and then rerun Evolutionary Solver, you could get a much different solution. For example, if EasyRide decides that pickup shortages are not such an important concern, it could reduce the unit shortage penalty from 50 to, say, 25 or even 5. Then the production schedule might change so that all seven models are not produced in week 1. (Take a look at the second worksheet in the finished version of the file to see how different penalty costs can lead to a very different solution.)</p>
