Along the way to the solution of this problem, which highlights the various aspects of the Coulomb friction model, we arrive at a result that demonstrates once again that intuition based on experience with static systems cannot be trusted. A free-body diagram shows <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span> and the weight, as well as normal forces <span class="tex-text">\(2 \bar{N}\)</span> and friction forces <span class="tex-text">\(2 \bar{f}\)</span> exerted between the two end plates and the ground. The relationship between <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{N}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{f}\)</span> is governed by Coulomb&#8217;s laws, which we will address separately. Here the friction force <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{f}\)</span> is depicted as acting to the left, based on the assumption that it opposes the action of <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span>, but we will be able to verify that assumption. We select the center of mass as the reference point for summing moments because the drum is in general motion. The axes of the body-fixed <span class="tex-text">\(x y z\)</span> coordinate system are defined to be horizontal and vertical, which matches the direction of the motion.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We know that the drum is in planar motion and that the center follows a horizontal path. Thus, regardless of the slipping condition, we know that</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\bar{\alpha}=\dot{\omega} \bar{k}, \quad \bar{a}_{G}=\dot{v} \bar{i}\)</span>. (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that we have selected the sense of positive <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\omega\)</span> to match the direction of the respective axis, but any other selection is acceptable if it is implemented consistently. In the special case where the drum rolls without slipping, the rotation will occur about the negative <span class="tex-text">\(z\)</span> axis, with</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(v=-\omega R_{1}\)</span> for no slippage. (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The centroidal moment of inertia corresponding to the given radius of gyration is <span class="tex-text">\(I_{z z}=m \kappa^{2} .\)</span> The equations of motion are</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{array}{c}\Sigma \bar{F} \cdot \bar{i}=F-2 f=m \dot{v}, \\\\\Sigma \bar{F} \cdot \bar{\jmath}=2 N-m g=0, \\\\\Sigma \bar{M}_{A} \cdot \bar{k}=F R_{2}-2 f R_{1}=m \kappa^{2} \dot{\omega}.\end{array} \)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are four unknowns, <span class="tex-text">\(f, N, \dot{v}\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{\omega}\)</span>, in these three equations. In general, the only available relations between force and kinematical variables in a kinetics problem are the equations of motion, so the additional equation required for solving Eqs.(3) must relate <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(N\)</span> or <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{v}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{\omega}\)</span>. This is where the question of slippage enters. It is given that the drum starts from rest, so initially the drum rolls without slipping. This means that Eq. (2) applies. The contacting surfaces then are described by Coulomb&#8217;s law for static friction, because the surfaces do not move relative to each other. Thus we know a priori only that the magnitude of <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{f}\)</span> is less than <span class="tex-text">\(\mu_{s} N\)</span> times. The actual magnitude and sense of <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{f}\)</span> are dictated by the laws of motion. In effect, the friction force is a constraint force-it prevents the relative movement of the contacting surfaces.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When Eq. (2) is substituted into Eqs. (3), the result is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\large \dot{v}=\frac{F R_{1}\left(R_{1}-R_{2}\right)}{m\left(R_{1}^{2}+\kappa^{2}\right)}, \quad f=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{R_{1} R_{2}+\kappa^{2}}{R_{1}^{2}+\kappa^{2}}\right) F. \)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The signs of <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{v}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> are both positive, so the sense initially assumed for both quantities is correct. This means that the drum rolls to the right and rotates clockwise. Kinematically, this implies that the cable gets wound around the drum, even though <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span> seems to act to pull it off the drum. The explanation of this behavior lies in the result for <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{v} .\)</span> We know that <span class="tex-text">\(F\left(R_{1}-R_{2}\right)\)</span> is the moment of <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span> about the contact point, and <span class="tex-text">\(m\left(R_{1}^{2}+\kappa^{2}\right)\)</span> is the moment of inertia about an axis parallel to <span class="tex-text">\(z\)</span> intersecting the contact point. Replacing <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{v}\)</span> with <span class="tex-text">\(-\dot{\omega} R_{1}\)</span> shows that the motion is a consequence of angular acceleration caused by <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span> exerting a moment about the contact point. (Recall that the contact point is an allowable point when there is no slipping, provided that the wheel is balanced.) The maximum magnitude of <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{F}\)</span> that can be sustained corresponds to impending slippage, at which <span class="tex-text">\(|\bar{f}|=\mu_{s} N .\)</span> From the force equation of motion in the <span class="tex-text">\(y\)</span> direction we have <span class="tex-text">\(N=\frac{1}{2} m g\)</span>, so the second of Eqs. (4) correspondingly gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\large F_{\mathrm{max}}=\frac{R_{1}^{2}+\kappa^{2}}{R_{1} R_{2}+\kappa^{2}} \mu_{s} m g.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
When slipping occurs because <span class="tex-text">\(|\bar{F}|&gt;F_{\max }\)</span>, the friction force is governed by the kinetic portion of Coulomb&#8217;s friction law, which states that <span class="tex-text">\(|\bar{f}|=\mu_{k} N\)</span> in opposition to the relative sliding motion. We know this sense from the solution of the no-slip case, which indicated that <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{f}\)</span> acts to the left. Thus we substitute <span class="tex-text">\(f=\mu_{k} N=\mu_{k} m g\)</span> into Eqs. (3). Note that, when slippage occurs, the friction force no longer acts to constrain the sliding, so there is no kinematical relation between <span class="tex-text">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>. The solution of Eqs. (3) now is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\large\dot{v}=\frac{F}{m}-\mu_{k} g, \quad \dot{\omega}=\frac{F R_{2}}{m \kappa^{2}}-\frac{\mu_{k} g R_{1}}{\kappa^{2}}.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The positive sign for <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{\omega}\)</span> indicates that the rotation is counterclockwise. Thus the drum will accelerate to the right and the cable will unwrap when <span class="tex-text">\(F\)</span> is sufficiently large to cause slippage.</p>
