We begin by making some reasonable guesses of relevant data. Let us assume we have a 70-kg astronaut who threw his 1-kg uniform at a speed of 20 m/s. For conve-nience, we set the positive direction of the <em>x </em>axis to be the di- rection of the throw (Fig. 9.2). Let us also assume that the x axis is tangent to the circular path of the spacecraft. We take the system to consist of the astronaut and the uni- form. Because of the gravitational force (which keeps the as-tronaut, his uniform, and the entire spacecraft in orbit), the system is not really isolated. However, this force is directed perpendicular to the motion of the system. Therefore, mo- mentum is constant in the <em>x </em>direction because there are no external forces in this direction. The total momentum of the system before the throw is zero (<em>m</em><sub>1</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub><em><sub>i</sub></em> + <em>m</em><sub>2</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub><em><sub>i</sub></em> = 0). Therefore, the total momentum af- ter the throw must be zero; that is, <em>m</em><sub>1</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub><em><sub>f</sub></em> + <em>m</em><sub>2</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub><em><sub>f</sub></em> =0</p>
 <p class="blog">
With <span class="tex-text">\( m_{1}=70 \mathrm{~kg}, \mathbf{v}_{2 f}=20 \mathbf{i} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s},\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( m_{2}=1 \mathrm{~kg},\)</span> solving for</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( \mathbf{v}_{1 f},\)</span> we find the recoil velocity of the astronaut to be</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \mathbf{v}_{1 f}=-\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} \mathbf{v}_{2 f}=-\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~kg}}{70 \mathrm{~kg}}\right)(20 \mathrm{i} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})=-0.3 \mathrm{i} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}\)</span> <p class="blog">
The negative sign for <strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub><em><sub>f</sub></em> indicates that the astronaut is mov- ing to the left after the throw, in the direction opposite the direction of motion of the uniform, in accordance with New- ton’s third law. Because the astronaut is much more massive than his uniform, his acceleration and consequent velocity are much smaller than the acceleration and velocity of the uniform.</p>
