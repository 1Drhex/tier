            <p class="blog">CF is about to commence trading as a wholesaler of hats. CF’s only shareholders, Mr and Mrs Topper, worked as employees of a hat retailer for many years, but have recently been made redundant. They intend to subscribe $200,000 as the initial share capital.<br /> Sales in 2002 are expected to be as follows:<br /> . Units<br /> January 2,400<br /> February 3,600<br /> March 4,800<br /> Thereafter 9,600 each month<br /> The average selling price of each hat is to be $10. All sales will be made on credit terms, requiring settlement two months after the date of sale. However, if settlement is made by customers within one month, a 2.5% cash discount will be given. Of the total sales, 60% are expected to be settled two months after the date of sale and 40% (before any discount is deducted) are expected to be settled one month after the date of sale.<br /> The average purchase price for each hat will be $7. CF intends to make purchases at the end of each month in order to maintain inventory at a sufficient level to cover the following month’s sales. Initially, therefore, purchases of 2,400 hats will be made in December 2001. Payment for purchases will be made one month in arrears.<br /> Fixed assets are expected to cost $250,000, payable in January 2002. Depreciation on these assets will be $5,000 each month, commencing January 2002. These fixed assets are likely to have a low net realisable value.<br /> Annual rent is expected to be $24,000 and will be payable quarterly in advance, commencingJanuary 2002. Monthly wages are expected to be $4,000 and are payable in the month they are incurred. Other overheads are expected to be $6,000 each month, half of which are payable in the month they are incurred and half are payable one month later.<br /> Mr and Mrs Topper are considering approaching the bank for an overdraft or loan finance, or a mixture of both. They are also unsure of the conditions that might attach to any finance that the bank may offer.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Prepare a monthly cash budget for CF for the period January 2002 to May 2002 inclusive. It should show the expected net cash flow for each month and the cumulative budgeted cash surplus or deficit at the end of each month. Assume for the purposes of this cash budget that the bank has not provided any loan finance. Ignore interest charges and taxation payments.</p>

 <p class="blog">
Factors to be considered by the bank<br /> Conduct of the account – If you have a previous history at the bank, this could be viewed favourably. In these circumstances, however, any such history is likely to be as salaried employees, rather than in the context of running a business account.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Gearing – You have committed $200,000 of your own money, but the bank is unlikely to commit itself to a high proportion of this figure, as the majority financing would normally be equity. The maximum financing requirement of $174,640 might be rather high relative to this figure, representing gearing of 47%.<br /> Security – Where assets can be offered giving adequate security, the bank is more likely to extend finance. In terms of corporate assets, the fixed assets of $250,000 may offer some security, but this seems unlikely to be significant given their highly specific nature and low net realisable value. Working capital may offer some security as a floating charge but, to the extent that working capital levels may fluctuate, their ability to act as security is also reduced. Notwithstanding this, at the end of May when the maximum financing requirement occurs there is a closing inventory of $67,200 (see W2) and closing receivables of $95,040 (see Appendix A). This totals to $162,240 of current assets, which could act as some security under a floating charge. Other than inventory and receivables, personal guarantees by the directors secured on their homes look to be the only reasonable security that would suggest a loan approaching the maximum of $174,640.<br /> Term – A shorter-term commitment is likely to be less risky to the bank than a longerterm loan. When cash flows reach a steady state based upon sales of 9,600 units, there will be a significant net cash inflow of $15,840 each month, which will systematically reduce the deficit (see Appendix A). Thus, to a large extent, the financing requirement is short-term and self-correcting. This may be viewed favourably by the bank if it considers that the budgeted cash flows can be achieved with a high degree of certainty.<br /> Management – You have some previous knowledge of the industry and, in a different context, some experience of management. If this can be demonstrated to the bank, it might be given greater confidence to extend financial support. This might include appropriate planning and a cash flow statement based upon reasonable assumptions.<br /> Profitability – It is necessary for the entity to demonstrate profitability as well as surplus operating cash flows if the business is to be sustained and assets replaced in the longer run. The monthly operating cash surplus in steady state (from the calculations in Appendix A) is $15,840. From this, however, it is necessary to deduct depreciation of $5,000 per month in order to obtain profit (Appendix B). Monthly profit is thus $10,840 in steady state. Any interest, tax and dividends would need to be deducted to calculate retained profit.<br /> Risk – Where the business is seen as risky, the bank might be less willing to lend money (or might charge a higher rate of interest) as, to an extent, it participates in this risk. The factors the bank is likely to consider include:</p>
 <p class="blog">
● whether you have purchased an established business with customers or whether it has just been set up;<br /> ● state of the order book;<br /> ● competitors;<br /> ● stability of the industry;<br /> ● level of fixed costs;<br /> ● existence of long term contracts.<br /> Appendix A<br /> Steady state cash flow (per month)</p>
