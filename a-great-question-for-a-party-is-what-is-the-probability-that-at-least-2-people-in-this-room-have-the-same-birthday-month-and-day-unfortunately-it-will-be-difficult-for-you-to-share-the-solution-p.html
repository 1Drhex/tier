Let M be the number in the group and A be the event “at least 1 pair<br /> has a common birthday.” Now, to find the probability of A directly would be very<br /> tedious, since we would have to take into account the possibility of more than 1 pair of<br /> matching birthdays. It is easier to find the probability that “all M people have different<br /> birthdays”; this is <span class="tex-text">\(\overline{A}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Since there are 365 possible birthdays for each person and each can be associated<br /> with every possible birthday of other individuals, the total number of equally likely<br /> distinct arrangements for M people is <span class="tex-text">\(365^{M} \)</span>. Next, we ask how many of these outcomes<br /> are contained in the event A, that is, how many that involve the M individuals all having<br /> different birthdays. This is precisely the same as asking in how many ways M<br /> birthdays can be selected from 365 possible birthdays and arranged in order. The first<br /> person’s birthday can occur on any of 365 days, the second on any of 364 days, the third<br /> on any of 363 days, and so forth. Thus, for M people the number of different birthdays<br /> is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
(365) (364) (363) &#8230; (365 &#8211; M + 1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The number of possible birthdays for M people is <span class="tex-text">\(365^{M} \)</span> 365M. Hence, the probability that all<br /> M birthdays will be different is as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(\overline{A} \right) =\frac{\left(365\right)\left(364\right) \cdot \cdot \cdot \left(365- M+ 1\right) }{365^{M} }\)</span> <p class="blog">
The required probability of at least two persons is the complement:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P\left(A\right)=1-P\left(\overline{A} \right) =1- \frac{\left(365\right)\left(364\right) \cdot \cdot \cdot \left(365- M+ 1\right) }{365^{M} }\)</span> <p class="blog">
Probabilities for selected numbers of people, M, are</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="597"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="91">M</td> <td width="85">10</td> <td width="61">20</td> <td width="72">22</td> <td width="72">23</td> <td width="72">30</td> <td width="72">40</td> <td width="72">60</td> </tr> <tr> <td>P(A)</td> <td>0.117</td> <td>0.411</td> <td>0.476</td> <td>0.507</td> <td>0.706</td> <td>0.891</td> <td>0.994</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
If at least 23 people are in the group, the probability of at least 1 pair with the same<br /> birthday exceeds 0.50. This probability rises sharply as the group size increases, until,<br /> with 60 people in the group, we are almost certain to find at least 1 pair. This result is<br /> surprising to most people. The probability that any given pair of people will have the<br /> same birthday is 1/365. But as the group size increases, the number of possible matches<br /> increases, until the probability of at least one match becomes quite large. Here, we have<br /> the union of events that are individually unlikely, but when the events are considered<br /> together, the probability is quite large. Careful analysis using the rather simple probability<br /> rules sometimes leads to surprising results.</p>
