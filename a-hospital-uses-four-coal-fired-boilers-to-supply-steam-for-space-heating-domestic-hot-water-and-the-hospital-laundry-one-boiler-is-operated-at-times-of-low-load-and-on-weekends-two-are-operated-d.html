            <p class="blog">A hospital uses four coal-fired boilers to supply steam for space heating, domestic hot water, and the hospital laundry. One boiler is operated at times of low load and on weekends, two are operated during the week, and the third boiler is normally off-line. The design efficiency on a steady load is generally about 78%. The boilers at the hospital were being run at between 70% and 73% efficiency, due to inadequate instrumentation and controls. Engineers have proposed that the boiler controls be upgraded. The upgrade would consist of installing variable-speed drives for the boiler fans and using the fans in conjunction with oxygen trim equipment for combustion control.<br /> • The cost of implementing the project is $159,000. The boilers have a remaining service life of 12 years. Any upgrade will have no salvage value at the end of 12 years.<br /> • The annual electricity use in the boiler house is expected to be reduced from 410,000 kWh to 180,000 kWh as a result of variable speed control of the boiler fan (because with the variable-speed drives, the fan motors draw only the power actually required to supply air to the boilers). This is equivalent to $14,000 per year. This savings is expected to increase at an annual rate of 4% as the cost of electricity increases over time.<br /> • Coal use will be 2% lower due to the projected improvement in boiler efficiency. This corresponds to a cost reduction of $40,950 per year. This savings is projected to increase as the coal price increases at an annual rate of 5%. If the hospital uses a 10% interest rate for any project justification, what would be the annual equivalent energy savings due to the improvement?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Given:</strong> The cash flow diagram in Figure 6.1 ; i = 10% per year .<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> The AE.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/10/1-76.png"></div>

<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Since energy savings are in two different geometric gradient series, we calculate the equivalent present worth in the following steps:<br /> • Savings in electricity:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P<span class="tex-text">\(_{Savings in electricity }\)</span> = $14,000(P/A<span class="tex-text">\(_{1}\)</span>,4%,10%,12)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= \$ 14,000 \left[\frac{1 &#8211; (1 + 0.04)^{12} (1 + 0.10)^{-12}}{0.10 &#8211; 0.04} \right]\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $114,301 .</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Savings in coal usage:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P<span class="tex-text">\(_{Savings in coal usage}\)</span> = $40,950(P/A<span class="tex-text">\(_{1}\)</span>,5%,10%,12)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= \$ 40,950 \left[\frac{1 &#8211; (1 + 0.05)^{12} (1 + 0.10)^{-12}}{0.10 &#8211; 0.05} \right]\)</span><br /> = $350,356 .</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Net present worth calculation:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(10%) = $114,301 + $350,356 &#8211; $159,000<br /> = $305,657.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since PW(10%) &gt; 0, the project would be acceptable under the PW analysis.<br /> Now, spreading the NPW over the project life gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">AE(10%) = $305,657(A/P,10%,12)<br /> = $44,859.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since AE(10%) &gt; 0, the project is also worth undertaking. The positive AE value indicates that the project is expected to bring in a net annual benefit of $44,859 over the life of the project.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> Table 6.1 illustrates how we might calculate the annual equivalent value by using Excel. To speed up the cash flow input process, we may enter the two different geometric series by using Columns B and C. In Column D, these two cash flows are combined and the project balances are calculated in Column E. Then, we calculate the net present worth first at 10%, followed by the annual equivalent value. These are shown in the outputs section.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>METHODOLOGY </strong><br /> Find the present worth of the flow, and then find the AE of the present worth.</p>
