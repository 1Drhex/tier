We first need to compute the size of the annual loan repayment installments:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">$64,800(A/P, 12%, 5) = $17, 976.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, we determine the repayment schedule of the loan by itemizing both the interest and the principal represented in each annual repayment. The resulting after‐tax cash flow is detailed in Table 10.3 . The present‐worth equivalent of the after‐tax cash flow series is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%) = -$122,200 + $45,392(P/F, 15%, 1) + . . . + $106, 036(P/F, 15%, 5)<br /> = $63,816.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When this amount is compared with the amount found in the case that involved no borrowing, $52,008, we see that debt financing actually increases the present worth by $11,808. This surprising result is caused entirely by the fact that the firm is able to borrow the funds at a lower rate, 12%, than its MARR (opportunity cost rate) of 15%.<br /> However, we should be careful in interpreting the result. It is true, to some extent, that firms can usually borrow money at lower rates than their MARR. However, if the firm can borrow money at a significantly lower rate, this factor also affects the firm’s MARR because the borrowing rate is one of the elements used in determining the MARR as we will see in Section 11.4. Therefore, a significant difference between present values with borrowing and without borrowing is not always expected in practice.</p>

Note: The amount of interest and principal to be paid in each period can be easily obtained with Excel.<br /> • Interest payment: = IMPT (rate, period, loan life, borrowing amount). For example, to find the interest payment in period 2, we use the following format: “ = IMPT(12%,2,5,-64800) ”<br /> • Principal payment: = PPMT (rate, period, loan life, borrowing amount). For example, to find the principal payment in period 2, we use the following format: “ = PPMT(12%,2, 5,-64800) ”</p>
