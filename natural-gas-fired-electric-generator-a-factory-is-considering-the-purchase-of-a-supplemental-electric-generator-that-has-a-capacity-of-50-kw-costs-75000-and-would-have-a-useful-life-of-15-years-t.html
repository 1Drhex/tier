            <p class="blog"><strong>Natural-Gas Fired Electric Generator</strong></p> <p class="blog">A factory is considering the purchase of a supplemental electric generator that has a capacity of 50 kW, costs $75,000, and would have a useful life of 15 years. The generator is 35 percent efficient in converting the chemical energy of the natural gas into electric energy. The current price of natural gas is $0.80 per therm. Maintenance expense is expected to be $1,000 per year. Investors who are in the business of leasing such equipment would expect a rate of return of 9 percent per year, so the factory will use that as its discount rate for the evaluation of this investment decision.</p> <p class="blog">(a) What is the capacity cost of the generator?<br /> (b) Considering only the use of natural gas as a fuel, what is the AVC per kWh generated?<br /> (c) Considering both the maintenance expense and the annualized cost of purchasing the generator, what are the fixed costs of operation per year? For <em>simplicity, ignore depreciation and other tax-related aspects of the purchase.</em><br /> (d) If the generator operates for 2,000 hours per year what is the ATC of the electric energy produced, per kilowatt-hour?</p>

(a) The capacity cost of the generator is the purchase price of the generator divided by its capacity, $75,000/50K = $1.50 per watt of capacity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) To find the cost of output, we must first look at the technology from the engineering perspective and perform an input–output analysis. Its input is natural gas (in therms, 100,000 BTU) and its output is electric energy (in kilowatt-hours, kWh), but the process is only 35 percent efficient. The conversion factor from BTU to kWh is 1 BTU = 0.00029307 kWh, so 1 therm = 29.307 kWh. At 35 percent efficiency, the output from the generator will be only 29.307 × 35 percent = 10.26 kWh per therm of natural gas input. Now use the input-price information to determine the AVC of the output: each therm costs $0.80, so the 10.26 kWh produced from 1 therm costs $0.80/10.26 = $0.078. In other words, the AVC of production is 7.8 cents per kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The maintenance expense is a fixed cost of $1,000 per year. The purchase price of $75,000, levelized over 15 years at a discount rate of 9 percent per year has an annualized cost given by the Excel formula =PMT(9%,15,75000), which is a fixed cost of $9,304.42 per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) If the generator operates at a rate of 50 kW for 2,000 hours per year, it will produce 50 × 2,000 = 100,000 kWh of electric energy. At that level of output, the maintenance cost of $1,000 per year contributes $1,000/100,000 = $0.01 per kWh to the AFC of the electric energy. Dividing the annualized purchase price, $9,304.42 by 100,000 kWh output per year adds $0.093/kWh or 9.3 cents per kWh to the AFC of using the generator for 2,000 hours per year. Thus, the maintenance cost and the annualized purchase price add $0.01 + $0.093 = $0.103 or 10.3 cents per kWh to the ATC of production. Together with the AVC of 7.8 cents per kWh found in part (a), this gives an ATC of $0.181 or 18.1 cents per kWh of electric energy output, when the generator is run for 2,000 hours per year.</p>
