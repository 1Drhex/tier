Refer to the seven-step procedure in Table 1-1 (left-hand side) to answer these questions:<br /> (a) Does your friend have a problem? If so, what is it?<br /> (b) What are her alternatives? (Identify at least three.)<br /> (c) Estimate the economic consequences and other required data for the alternatives in Part (b).<br /> (d) Select a criterion for discriminating among alternatives, and use it to advise your friend on which course of action to pursue.<br /> (e) Attempt to analyze and compare the alternatives in view of at least one criterion in addition to cost.<br /> (f) What should your friend do based on the information you and she have generated?</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <p class="blog">TABLE 1-1 The General Relationship between the Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure and the Engineering Design Process</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="536"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="303">Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure</td> <td width="233">Engineering Design Process (see Figure P1-15 on p. 19)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Step</td> <td>Activity</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.

(a) A quick set of calculations shows that your friend does indeed have a problem. A lot more money is being spent by your friend each year ($10,500+$15,000=$25,500) than is being received (4×$360×12=$17,280). The problem could be that the monthly rent is too low. She’s losing $8,220 per year. (Now, that’s a problem!)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Option (1). Raise the rent. (Will the market bear an increase?)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option (2). Lower maintenance expenses (but not so far as to cause safety problems).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option (3). Sell the apartment building. (What about a loss?)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option (4). Abandon the building (bad for your friend’s reputation).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) Option (1). Raise total monthly rent to $1,440+$R for the four apartments to cover monthly expenses of $2,125. Note that the minimum increase in rent would be ($2,125−$1,440)/4=$171.25 per apartment per month (almost a 50% increase!).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option (2). Lower monthly expenses to $2,125−$C so that these expenses are covered by the monthly revenue of $1,440 per month. This would have to be accomplished primarily by lowering the maintenance cost. (There’s not much to be done about the annual mortgage cost unless a favorable refinancing opportunity presents itself.) Monthly maintenance expenses would have to be reduced to ($1,440−$10,500/12)=$565. This represents more than a 50% decrease in maintenance expenses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Option (3). Try to sell the apartment building for $X, which recovers the original $10,000 investment and (ideally) recovers the $685 per month loss ($8,220÷12) on the venture during the time it was owned.<br /> Option (4). Walk away from the venture and kiss your investment good-bye. The bank would likely assume possession through foreclosure and may try to collect fees from your friend. This option would also be very bad for your friend’s credit rating.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) One criterion could be to minimize the expected loss of money. In this case, you might advise your friend to pursue Option (1) or (3).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) For example, let’s use “credit worthiness” as an additional criterion. Option (4) is immediately ruled out. Exercising Option (3) could also harm your friend’s credit rating. Thus, Options (1) and (2) may be her only realistic and acceptable alternatives.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(f) Your friend should probably do a market analysis of comparable housing in the area to see if the rent could be raised (Option 1). Maybe a fresh coat of paint and new carpeting would make the apartments more appealing to prospective renters. If so, the rent can probably be raised while keeping 100% occupancy of the four apartments</p>
