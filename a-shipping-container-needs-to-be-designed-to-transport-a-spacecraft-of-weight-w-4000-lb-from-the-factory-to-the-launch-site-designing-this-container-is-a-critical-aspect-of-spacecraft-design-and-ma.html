            <p class="blog">A shipping container needs to be designed to transport a spacecraft of weight W = 4000 lb from the factory to the<br /> launch site. Designing this container is a critical aspect of spacecraft design and manufacture. We are concerned<br /> with the vibration design criteria. In this example an engineer receives the design order with specifications for truck shipment: the load is specified as a “3ℑ decaying sinusoid with a decay rate (logarithmic decrement) δ = 0.5, with load occurring over the frequency range of 2 to 200 Hz.” Figure 4.23 illustrates this loading case for 5 Hz. The loading characteristics and the frequency range depend on the kinds of bumps in the road as well as the truck speed. How disturbances such as bumps get transmitted to the satellite is a function of the container properties.</p> <p class="blog">It is common in the study of shock and vibration, for example in earthquake engineering, to specify loading in terms of an acceleration. Here, the forcing is given in terms of the base acceleration, <span class="tex-text">\(\ddot{x}\)</span></p> <span class="tex-text">\(\ddot{x}=3 g e^{-t / \tau} \sin \omega t\)</span> <p class="blog">where ω is the driving frequency of the load, and τ = 1⁄(ζω) is the relaxation time. We will assume that the maximum load the spacecraft can withstand is 8<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span> at the center of gravity (CG) at frequencies below 15 Hz. Above<br /> 15 Hz, we assume that the spacecraft cannot resist any significant acceleration. Thus, the suspension system requirements must be derived for maximum attenuation in the vertical direction at frequencies greater than 15 Hz. Furthermore, we are told that to prevent coupling between the container suspension system and the spacecraft,<br /> the suspension system must have a natural frequency of 5 Hz or lower.21 If coupling occurs, a beatingtype behavior will result, leading to large amplitude motion. The satellite in its shipping configuration has a natural frequency of 20 Hz.</p> <p class="blog">The above information is provided to a shipping container subcontractor who then translates the requirements into a container design proposal for eventual approval by the owner of the spacecraft. One such proposal is: “The spacecraft will be mounted on a frame assembly which weighs 1550 lb. The frame assembly will be mounted on four shock mounts attached to the shipping container base. With the spacecraft installed, 4.0 in of clearance exists between the shipping container insulation and the spacecraft envelope. With a static spring constant of 1275 lb/in, dynamic spring constant22 of 1.3×1275 lb/in, and a damping factor of 11%, this system will satisfy suspension performance requirements.” The spacecraft owner must find some way to verify that the above container will safeguard the spacecraft on route to the launch site. Typically, shipping containers and their suspension systems are verified through drop tests. In this test, an equivalent mock satellite is dropped in such a container, released from a height resulting in a 3<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span> decaying sinusoid vibration input. This equivalent drop height must be estimated analytically to test the container.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/12/4.23.png"></div>

<strong>Solution Part One:</strong> The spacecraft-container system is idealized as a base-excited, single degree-of-freedom system. To establish the safety of the spacecraft in the container, we derive and solve the equation governing the spacecraft oscillation inside the container and show that the maximum response to the 3<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span> load is within the allowable space. This will verify the suspension system design. If internal impact occurs, the system must be redesigned. Once the system model is verified, we can determine a drop height to test the container’s suspension system. The test will verify that the design can be based on the simplified model. The base-excited system is shown in Figure 4.24. We assume that the satellite and the container CGs are centered. Thus, upon impact there are no eccentricities that will induce rotational motion. Also, we assume that there is no other motion of the container or of the structure (truck) upon which the container sits. All these assumptions can be relaxed if necessary for a more realistic and complicated model. The spacecraft mass is given by</p>

The input frequency has a range of <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> = 2 to 200 Hz. We<br /> calculate displacements over this range of frequencies in order to be certain that the maxima have been captured. From the definition of logarithmic decrement, we have</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\delta=\ln \frac{n^{t h} \text { peak of } \ddot{x}}{(n+1)^{t h} \text { peak of } \ddot{x}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
into which we can substitute the second derivative of <span class="tex-text">\(x(t)\)</span>,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\delta=\ln \frac{3 g \exp \left(-t_{n} / \tau\right)}{3 g \exp \left(-\left[t_{n}+T\right] / \tau\right)}\)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(t_{n}\)</span> is taken when <span class="tex-text">\(\sin \omega t_{n}=1 \text { and } T=2 \pi / \omega=1 / f\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\delta=\frac{T}{T}\)</span> <p class="blog">
and</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\tau=\frac{T}{\delta}=\frac{1}{f \delta}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Thus, the relaxation time constant for a frequency of <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> = 200 Hz and for δ = 0.5 is τ = 0.01 s. This can be interpreted physically as the time duration the structure is at its peak oscillation.<br /> From the shipping container suspension system parameters, the spring constant of all 4 shock mounts is <span class="tex-text">\(k\)</span> = 4 × 1.3 × 1275 = 6630 lb/in, and we are given the damping factor equal to 11%. The natural frequency of the suspension system is then</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(f_{n}=\frac{\omega_{n}}{2 \pi}=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}=4.028 Hz\)</span> <p class="blog">
the damped natural frequency is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(f_{d}=\frac{\omega_{d}}{2 \pi}=\frac{\omega_{n} \sqrt{1-\zeta^{2}}}{2 \pi}=4.003 Hz\)</span> <p class="blog">
and the damping constant is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(c=2 m \zeta \omega_{n}=57.64 lb s / in\)</span> <p class="blog">
The governing equation of motion for a base-excited structure is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(m \ddot{y}+c(\dot{y}-\dot{x})+k(y-x)=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(y(t)\)</span> is the structural response, and <span class="tex-text">\(x(t)\)</span> and<span class="tex-text">\(\dot{x}(t)\)</span> are the base container input displacement and velocity, respectively. These can be found by integrating Equation 4.35 twice beginning with <span class="tex-text">\(\ddot{x}=3 g e^{-t / \tau} \operatorname{ain} \omega t=\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(3 g e^{\rho t} \sin \omega t\)</span>, where we define <span class="tex-text">\(\rho=-1 / \tau\)</span>. Assuming zero initial velocity, the first integration results in</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{x}=\frac{3 g}{\rho^{2}+\omega^{2}}\left[-\omega e^{\rho t} \cos \omega t+\rho e^{\rho t} \operatorname{ain} \omega t+\omega\right]\)</span> <p class="blog">
A second integration, assuming zero initial displacement, yields</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}x(t)=&amp;-\frac{3 g}{\rho^{4}+2 \rho^{2} \omega^{2}+\omega^{4}}\left[2 e^{\rho t} \omega \rho \cos \omega t\right.\\&amp;\left.+e^{\rho t}\left(\omega^{2}-\rho^{2}\right) \sin \omega t-\omega t \rho^{2}-\omega^{3} t-2 \omega \rho\right]\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Substituting Equations 4.37 and 4.38 into the governing Equation 4.36 results in an equation of motion that can be solved numerically,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&amp;m \ddot{y}+c \dot{y}+k y \\&amp;=\frac{3 g c}{\rho^{2}+\omega^{2}}\left[-\omega e^{\rho t} \cos \omega t+\rho e^{\rho t} \sin \omega t+\omega\right] \\&amp;+\frac{3 g k}{\rho^{4}+2 \rho^{2} \omega^{2}+\omega^{4}}\left[2 e^{\rho t} \omega \rho \cos \omega t+e^{\rho t}\left(\omega^{2}-\rho^{2}\right) \sin \omega t\right. \\&amp;\left.-\omega t \rho^{2}-\omega^{3} t-2 \omega \rho\right] .\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Note that there are secular terms (terms that grow with time) in the last line. The ω term in Equation 4.37 led to the secular terms and the term 2ωρ of Equation 4.38. These arise from the requirement that <span class="tex-text">\(x(0)=0 \text { and } \dot{x}(0)=0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Such terms are signs of potential trouble and instability, but they do not cause difficulties here in the numerical solution of the Equation 4.39. We are interested only in the first cycle of the oscillation, that is,<br /> for small time t &lt;&lt; 1 s. This is when the spacecraft is exposed to the peak amplitudes and accelerations. For a range of frequencies, this equation can be solved for the maximum spacecraft acceleration and<br /> for the maximum spacecraft/container relative displacement. This information allows us to determine whether the system requirements are met. Table 4.1 shows how maximum spacecraft acceleration <span class="tex-text">\(\ddot{y}\)</span> and maximum relative displacement (<span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> − <span class="tex-text">\(y\)</span>) vary as a function of driving frequency <span class="tex-text">\(f\)</span> .Since <span class="tex-text">\(\omega=2 \pi f, \rho=-1 / \tau=-f \delta\)</span></p>

The system model meets the requirements that the maximum acceleration is less than 8<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span> and the maximum displacement is less than 4 in. From Table 4.1, for the range of frequencies 2 to 4 Hz there is dynamic coupling between the spacecraft container and the truck suspension, resulting in significant satellite motion. At higher frequencies, for example 14 to 200 Hz, the shock loads are isolated as required by the design specifications.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Solution Part Two:</strong> The second part of this solution is the determination of the drop height that results in loads and displacements similar to the 3<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span> decaying sinusoid. This drop height will be used to design an experiment to verify compliance with design requirements. The height will be determined using the single degree-offreedom model just developed. From basic physics, when an object is dropped from rest at height <span class="tex-text">\(h\)</span>, its gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, and at the instant of impact, <span class="tex-text">\(m g h=m v_{0}^{2} / 2,\)</span> from which</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_{0}=\sqrt{2 g h}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Once the container strikes the ground, the internal component will oscillate in free vibration with initial velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v_{0}\)</span>. It is assumed that upon impact, the container remains in contact with the ground rather than bounce up and down. During the free fall, the springs are in a zero or unstretched position, but after impact the oscillation will be about the equilibrium. Therefore, there will also be an initial displacement <span class="tex-text">\(y_{0}\)</span> given by <span class="tex-text">\(k y_{0}=m g\)</span> and</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(y_{0}=\frac{m g}{k}=\frac{4000}{4 \cdot 1275}=0.784 in\)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(k\)</span> is the static stiffness constant for all four springs. To make the equations above work, we need to guess an initial height <span class="tex-text">\(h\)</span>, and then use Equation 4.40 to calculate initial velocity <span class="tex-text">\(\dot{y}(0)=-v_{0}\)</span>. The initial displacement <span class="tex-text">\(y(0)=y_{0}\)</span> is independent of the initial height. Governing Equation 4.36 becomes</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(m \ddot{y}+c y+k y=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
since <span class="tex-text">\(x=0 \text { and } \dot{x}=0\)</span></p>

We choose <span class="tex-text">\(h\)</span> = 20 in as the height for a drop test to verify the protective value of the satellite container. This is because of the requirement that maximum relative displacement be less than 4 in and the maximum acceleration be less that 8<span class="tex-text">\(g\)</span>. Both these conditions are met by the drop test height <span class="tex-text">\(h\)</span> = 20 in. The interior of the box will be instrumented and the drop test results will (or will not) verify the analytical predictions of Table 4.2.</p>
