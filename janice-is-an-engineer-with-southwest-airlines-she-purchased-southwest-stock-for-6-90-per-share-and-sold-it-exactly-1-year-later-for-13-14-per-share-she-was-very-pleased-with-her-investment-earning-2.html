(a) The effective annual rate of return <span class="tex-text">\(i_{a}\)</span> has a compounding period of 1 year, since the stock purchase and sales dates are exactly 1 year apart. Based on the purchase price of $6.90 per share and using the definition of interest rate in Equation [1.2] <span class="tex-text">\(Interest rate= \frac{ d per time unit }{principal} \times 100\% \)</span> ,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i_{a}= \frac{ amount of increase per 1 year }{original price} \times 100\%=\frac{6.24}{6.90}\times 100\%=90.43\% \)</span>per year</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) For the effective annual rates of 90.43% per year, compounded quarterly, and 90.43%, compounded monthly, apply Equation [4.4] <span class="tex-text">\(i=(1+i_{a})^{1/m} -1\)</span> to find corresponding effective rates on the basis of each compounding period.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Quarter: m = 4 times per year <span class="tex-text">\( i = (1.9043)^{1∕4} − 1 = 1.17472 − 1 = 0.17472\)</span><br /> This is 17.472% per quarter, compounded quarterly.<br /> Month: m = 12 times per year <span class="tex-text">\( i = (1.9043)^{1∕12} − 1 = 1.05514 − 1 = 0.05514\)</span><br /> This is 5.514% per month, compounded monthly</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comment</strong><br /> Note that these quarterly and monthly rates are less than the effective annual rate divided by the number of quarters or months per year. In the case of months, this would be 90.43%∕12 = 7.54% per month. This computation is incorrect because it neglects the fact that compounding takes place 12 times during the year to result in the effective annual rate of 90.43%</p>
