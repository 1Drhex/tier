            <p class="blog"><strong>Residential Solar Photovoltaic Array</strong></p> <p class="blog">A 3 kW system of solar panels, with associated wiring, batteries, and DC–AC inverter, costs $14,400 to purchase and install. The owner can get a 30 percent income tax credit from the U.S. government for this investment. For an owner in Los Angeles, the solar panels will produce enough electric energy to save $1,050 per year that would otherwise be paid to the local electric utility company. The solar array should last 25 years. If the owner decides not to invest in the solar array, he or she could use the money to pay down his or her home mortgage, which will save him or her paying interest on the mortgage loan, which has an interest rate of 6 percent per year. Should he or she invest in the solar array?</p>

The first step in solving such a problem is to be clear about the cash flow. The initial cost of the system is the $14,400 sticker price minus the income tax credit of 30% × 14,400 = $4,320, for a net price of $10,080, which has to be paid today. The cash flow from the investment would be the $1,050 in saved energy expense per year for 25 years. To a spreadsheet program, the constant $1,050 per year is called the <em>payment </em>(think of the $1,050 as a payment back to the homeowner as a result of the invest­ment) and the 25 years is the <em>nper </em>of the cash flow. The discount rate that shows how money now is related to money in the future is the 6 percent rate of return that she would get if she <em>invested </em>the $10,080 to pay down her mortgage. To a spreadsheet program, that is called the <em>rate</em>. The pres­ent value of this 25-year cash flow of $1,050 per year can be calculated using the spreadsheet function PV using the following syntax,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=PV(<em>rate,nper,pmt</em>)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Typing =PV(6%,25,1050) into a cell of the spreadsheet program—and notice that the payment was given to the spreadsheet as 1050 with no comma—gives the answer.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">–$13,422.52.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To reiterate, spreadsheet programs return the answer as a negative num­ber, because spreadsheets keep track of cash inflows (positive) and cash outflows (negative). The interpretation of this problem is that you would be willing to pay out $13,422.52 (cash outflow, negative) today to buy the solar array in order to get the stream of future benefits described as the payment $1,050 per year (cash inflow, positive).</p>
 <p class="blog">
We interpret the answer to mean that the benefits from the solar array are worth $13,422.52 today. With the 30 percent tax credit, the system would cost only $10,080. Our analysis has shown that the system is worth $13,422.52. Therefore, the system’s value is greater than its cost, so the SPV system should be purchased.</p>
