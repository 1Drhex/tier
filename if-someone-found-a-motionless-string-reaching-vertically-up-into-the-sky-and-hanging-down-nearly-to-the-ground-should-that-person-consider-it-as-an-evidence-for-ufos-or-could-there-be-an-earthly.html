Assume that the string is of uniform cross-section and mass distribution, and is free at both ends. It orbits the Earth in such a way that its position relative to the Earth is always the same. Obviously, if the string is in a vertical position, the phenomenon could only occur at the Equator.<br /> In the Earth&#8217;s reference frame a body of mass <span class="tex-text">\( m \)</span> orbiting above the Equator at a distance <span class="tex-text">\( r \)</span> and with angular velocity <span class="tex-text">\(w \)</span> experiences a gravitational force of <span class="tex-text">\( -GMm/r^2 \)</span> and a centrifugal force of <span class="tex-text">\( mrw^2 \)</span>. Here <span class="tex-text">\( M \)</span> is the mass of the Earth and <span class="tex-text">\( G \)</span> is the gravitational constant. The condition for the equilibrium of the string is that the net force due to gravitation, which varies with <span class="tex-text">\( r, \)</span> is equal to that due to the centrifugal effect, which also changes from point to point. This condition can easily be derived using integral calculus, but it can also be found without using such sophisticated mathematics.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Imagine that the string is pulled down a little by some external force. Since (in the rotating frame of reference) the string was initially in equilibrium, it can be displaced from its equilibrium position by an arbitrarily small force and, to first order, the net work done in the course of the change must be zero. The displacement of the whole string-from the point of view of the work done-is equivalent to the slow migration of a small piece of the string, of mass <span class="tex-text">\( Δm, \)</span> from its top to its bottom. The work done is the sum of two terms, the change in the gravitational potential energy and the work done by the average centrifugal force (since the centrifugal force changes linearly). If the bottom end of the string of length <span class="tex-text">\( L \)</span> just touches the Earth&#8217;s surface, the work in question is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( W=GMΔm\left(\frac{1}{R}-\frac{1}{L+R} \right) -\Delta m\frac{R+(R+L)}{2}w^2L=0 \)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(R \)</span> is the radius of the Earth. This is a quadratic equation in <span class="tex-text">\( L, \)</span> which gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( L=\frac{R}{2}\left(-3+\sqrt{1+\frac{8GM}{R^3w^2} } \right) \approx 140 \ 000 \ km \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
using known data. This length is several times <span class="tex-text">\( r_s = (GM/w^2)^{ 1/3}≈ 42000 \ km,\)</span> the distance of telecommunications satellites from the centre of the Earth!</p>
 <p class="blog">
What is the maximum stress in the string? It is easy to establish that the greatest stress <span class="tex-text">\( σ_{max} \)</span> occurs at the position <span class="tex-text">\( r = r_s, \)</span> and satisfies <span class="tex-text">\( σ_{max}/ ρ = 4.8 \times 10^7 N \ m \ kg^{-1}, \)</span> where <span class="tex-text">\( ρ \)</span> is the mass density of the string. This figure for the ratio of tensile strength to density is much greater than that for known materials (for steel it is <span class="tex-text">\( 2.6 \times 10^5, \)</span> and for carbon <span class="tex-text">\( 1.7 \times 10^6 \)</span>). Therefore, whilst, in principle, a &#8216;hook to the sky&#8217; is consistent with Newton&#8217;s laws, at the present time it is impossible (at least with a string of constant cross-section) to find suitable materials from which to build it.</p>
