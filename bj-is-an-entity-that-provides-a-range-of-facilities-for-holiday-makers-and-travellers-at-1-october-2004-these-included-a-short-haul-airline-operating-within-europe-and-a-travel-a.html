            <p class="blog">BJ is an entity that provides a range of facilities for holiday makers and travellers. At 1 October 2004 these included:<br /> • a short haul airline operating within Europe; and</p> <p class="blog">• a travel agency specialising in arranging holidays to more exotic destinations, such as Hawaii and Fiji.<br /> BJ’s airline operation has made significant losses for the last two years. On 31 January 2005, the directors of BJ decided that, due to a significant increase in competition on short haul flights within Europe, BJ would close all of its airline operations and dispose of its fleet of aircraft. All flights for holiday makers and travellers who had already booked seats would be provided by third party airlines. All operations ceased on 31 May 2005.<br /> On 31 July 2005, BJ sold its fleet of aircraft and associated non-current assets for $500 million, the carrying value at that date was $750 million.<br /> At the balance sheet date, BJ were still in negotiation with some employees regarding severance payments. BJ has estimated that in the financial period October 2005 to September 2006, they will agree a settlement of $20 million compensation.<br /> The closure of the airline operation caused BJ to carry out a major restructuring of the entire entity. The restructuring has been agreed by the directors and active steps have been taken to implement it. The cost of restructuring to be incurred in year 2005/2006 is estimated at $10 million.<br /> Requirement<br /> Explain how BJ should report the events described above and quantify any amounts required to be included in its financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005.<br /> (Detailed disclosure notes are not required.)</p>

FRS 5 defines a discontinued operation as a component of an entity that has been disposed of and that represents a separate major line of business. A component of an entity is defined as operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity. The disposal of the airline business represents a separate major line of business; can be clearly distinguished and it was disposed of during the year.<br /> Conclusion<br /> The closure of the airline business should be treated as a discontinued operation and separately disclosed.<br /> The revenue and profit must be separately disclosed in the income statement.<br /> The $250 million loss on disposal of the aircraft fleet is material and must be shown on the face of the income statement.<br /> Employee severance payments are committed as a result of a past event (the disposal of the airline), they will have to be paid (they are certain to be paid) but the exact timing and amount are not yet known as they are still being negotiated. IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets requires a provision to be made, using the best estimate which is $20 million.<br /> The cost of restructuring the remaining division, even although that restructuring is required as a result of the decision to close the airline business, should be classified as restructuring costs within continuing activities, as the costs relate to the travel agency business and this is a continuing activity (IAS 37). As the restructuring has been publicised and the entity is committed to it, the liability of $10 million should be provided for. The cost should be reported in the income statement under continuing activities.</p>
