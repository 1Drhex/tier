The variables and constraints for this model are shown in Figure 7.34. (See the file Warehouse Location Big Picture.xlsx.) There are no constraints in this model, not even nonnegativity. The warehouse can be located at any x-y coordinate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> To develop the spreadsheet model, use the following steps (see Figure 7.35 and the file Warehouse Location Finished.xlsm<span class="tex-text">\()^{7}\)</span> :<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the given customer data in the light blue ranges.<br /> 2) Coordinates of warehouse. Enter any trial values in the Location range for the x-y coordinates of the warehouse.<br /> 3) Distances from warehouse to customers. Calculate the distances from the ware-house to the customers in the range B14:B17. To do so, recall from geometry that the (straight-line) distance between the two points (a, b) and (c, d) is Therefore, enter the formula<br /> =SQRT(SUMXMY2(B5:C5,Location))<br /> in cell B14 and copy it down to cell B17.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: SUMXMY2<br /> Microsoft realized that summing the squared differences between two ranges is common so it provided the Excel function SUMXMY2 (read “sum of x minus y squared”). This function has the syntax =SUMXMY2(xRange,yRange). For this example, it is equivalent to the longer form (B5-$B$11)^2+(C5-$C$11)^2. You can then take the square root to get distance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Total annual distance. The total annual distance traveled from the warehouse to meet the demands of all customers is the sum over all customers of the distance from the warehouse to the customer multiplied by the annual shipments for the customer. Therefore, calculate the total annual distance traveled in cell B19 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(E5:E8,B14:B17)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup for this model (not shown here) is straightforward. All you need to specify is that total annual distance should be minimized and the Location range contains the decision variable cells. There are no constraints, not even nonnegativity constraints. Also, because of the squares in the straight-line distance formula, this model is nonlinear, so the GRG Nonlinear method should be selected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The Solver solution in Figure 7.35 is represented graphically in Figure 7.36. The warehouse should be located at x 5 9.314 and y 5 5.029. Each year, a total of 5456.54 miles will be traveled from the warehouse to the customers. This solution represents a compromise. On the one hand, Lafferty would like to position the facility near customer 4 because the most trips are made to customer 4. However, because customer 4 is fairly far from the other customers, the warehouse is located in a more central position.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> One possible sensitivity analysis is to see how the optimal location of the warehouse changes as the annual number of shipments to any particular customer increases. We did this for customer 4 in Figure 7.37, using the number of shipments to customer 4 (cell E8) as the single input cell, allowing it to vary from 300 to 700 in increments of<br /> 50, and keeping track of the total annual distance and the warehouse location coordinates. As expected, the total annual distance increases as the annual shipments to customer 4 increase. Also, the warehouse gradually gets closer to customer 4. In fact, when the number of annual shipments to customer 4 is 550 or above, the optimal location for the warehouse is at customer 4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> The Lafferty model has no constraints. Therefore, Solver is guaranteed to find an optimal solution if the objective is a convex function of the coordinates of the warehouse. It can be shown (with some difficulty) that the annual distance traveled is indeed a convex function of the coordinates of the warehouse. Therefore, the Solver solution is optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, what if you do not know that the objective is a convex function of the coordinates? Then you could use the Multistart option. Alternatively, you could try different starting solutions in the Location range, run Solver on each of them, and see whether they all take you to the same solution. For variety, we have made this easy for you in the Warehouse Location Finished.xlsm file (see Figure 7.35). We have written two short macros that are automated by clicking buttons. You can click the left button to randomly generate a new starting location in the decision variable cells. Then you can click the right button to run Solver. They should always take you to the same solution<span class="tex-text">\(.^{8}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. The straight-line distance function used in the Lafferty example is relevant if the company is shipping by air. However, if the company is shipping by road, you must take into account that most roads are built in a north-south or east-west direction. Then the relevant distance between points (a, b) and (c, d ) is |a &#8211; c| + |b &#8211; d| (the sum of the absolute differences), and this objective should be used in place of the square root objective. Because of absolute values, it is still nonlinear.<br /> 2. Besides assuming straight-line distance, there are two other assumptions in the Lafferty example: (1) exactly one warehouse will be built, and (2) this warehouse can be built anywhere. In real-world facility location problems, it is often necessary to modify these assumptions. First, it might be possible to build several warehouses. Second, the possible locations might be restricted to a certain subset of geographical locations. And third, the distances from all potential warehouse locations to customers might be given<br /> by a distance matrix, rather than calculated from some formula. In this situation, an IP model with binary variables is more suitable. There is a 0-1 variable for each potential warehouse location (either build there or don’t) and a 0-1 variable for each ware house customer pair (either supply that customer from that warehouse or don’t). We ask you to model such a version of the warehouse location problem in one of the problems.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
7:This file contains a macro, hence the .xlsm extension (“m” for macro). When you open the file, a message bar might appear asking whether you want to enable the macro. You should do so because the macro won’t function unless you enable it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8:If you would like to have similar macros for other NLP models, it is fairly easy. With the Warehouse Location<br /> Finished.xlsm file open, press the Alt+F11 key combination to see the Visual Basic screen. The code for the macros is in the Module sheet for this file. Except for the line indicated in the code and the range address of the decision variable cells, these macros can be used for other models with no changes. However, to automate Solver with code, you need to select References from the Tools menu and check the Solver item.</p>
