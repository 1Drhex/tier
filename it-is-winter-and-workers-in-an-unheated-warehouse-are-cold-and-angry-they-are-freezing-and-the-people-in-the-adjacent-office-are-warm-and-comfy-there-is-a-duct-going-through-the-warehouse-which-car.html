            <p class="blog">It is winter and workers in an unheated warehouse are cold and angry. They are freezing, and the people in the adjacent office are warm and comfy. There is a duct going through the warehouse which carries hot air to the office for heating. The warehouse workers have asked the management to provide diffusers in the duct to supply some hot air to the warehouse, but their request has been denied. The workers have decided to take matters into their own hands. They have decided to use fans to blow the warehouse air over the hot air duct and get some heating from the forced convection. The details are as follows:<br /> The duct is 10 inches diameter and the section in the warehouse is 50 feet long. The air enters the warehouse section at a<br /> rate of 1100 cfm and a temperature of 130 F. The air in the warehouse space is at 45 F. Fans will blow the air in crossflow<br /> over the duct at a velocity of 8 m/s.<br /> <strong>(a)</strong> What is the temperature of the air in the duct as it leaves the warehouse?<br /> <strong>(b)</strong> How much heating will be added to the warehouse air (Btu/hr)?<br /> <strong>(c)</strong> What are some practical problems with this proposed heating of the warehouse?</p>

We will assume that the duct wall is thin and a constant temperature surface. To get air property values, we need to make some assumptions on temperatures. We will check these assumptions after the calculations and iterate as necessary. We will assume that the air temperature drops by 20 F from the entrance to the exit. The air enters at 130 F (54.44 C) and leaves at 110 F (43.33 C). The average temperature of the air in the duct is then (54.44 + 43.33)/2 = 48.89 C.<br /> We will also assume that the temperature of the duct wall is <span class="tex-text">\(T_{s} = 85 F = 29.44 C.\)</span><br /> We now proceed to get the convective coefficients <span class="tex-text">\(h_{i} and h_{o}\)</span> for the inside and outside surfaces of the duct.</p>

 <p class="blog">
<strong>Summarizing</strong>. We assumed the duct wall temperature was 85 F and we calculated it as 83.5 F.<br /> We assumed the exit temperature of the duct air was 110 F and we calculated it as 108.7 F.<br /> Our assumptions were close to the calculated values. We conclude that iteration is not necessary as it would have negligible impact on the results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Results</strong><br /> <strong>(a)</strong> Duct air exits at 109 F.<br /> <strong>(b)</strong> Heating added to the warehouse is about 22,700 Btu/hr.<br /> <strong>(c)</strong> Practical problems include the following:<br /> The large number of fans needed. (This is not a problem if the facility is a fan factory.)<br /> Mounting of the fans is a major installation task.<br /> The noise due to the fans will be considerable.<br /> There will be considerable increased electrical load for the fans.<br /> The obtained warehouse heating is not very large considering the major installation requirements and costs.We calculated that the use of the fans added 22,700 Btu/hr to the warehouse air. Actually, the impact of the fans is even less than this.<br /> Without the fans, there would be natural convection from the hot duct. Example 7.4 estimates this natural convection as 5930 Btu/hr. Hence, the fans will actually only add 22,700 &#8211; 5930 = 16,770 Btu/hr to the air. With such a low value, it is probably better to continue lobbying the management for diffusers in the hot air duct. Or, perhaps install gas-fired infrared heaters near the ceiling or unit heaters near the work stations in the warehouse.</p>
