            <p class="blog"><strong>Benefit-Cost Analysis of Three Routes</strong><br /> The state of Washington must decide between three highway alternatives to replace an old winding road. The length of the current route is 26 miles. Planners agree that the old road must be replaced or overhauled; they cannot keep it as it is.<br /> ■ Alternative A is to overhaul and resurface the old road at a cost of $2 million/mile. Resurfacing will also cost $2 million/mile at the end of each 10-year period. Annual maintenance will cost $10,000/mile.<br /> ■ Alternative B is to cut a new road following the terrain. It will be only 22 miles long. Its first cost will be $3 million/mile with resurfacing at 10-year intervals costing $2 million/mile with annual maintenance at $12,000/mile.<br /> ■ Alternative C also involves a new highway to be built along a 20.5-mile straight line. Its first cost will be $4 million/mile with resurfacing at 10-year intervals costing $2 million/mile and with annual maintenance costing $20,000/mile. This increase over Routes A and B is due to additional roadside bank retention efforts.<br /> Traffic density along each of the three routes will fluctuate widely from day to day but will average 4,000 vehicles/day throughout the 365-day year. This volume is composed of 350 light trucks, 250 heavy trucks, and 80 motorcycles, and the remaining 3,320 are automobiles. The average operation cost for each of these vehicles is $0.70, $1.10, $0.30, and $0.60 per mile, respectively.<br /> There will be a time savings because of the different distances along each of the routes, as well as different speeds that each of the routes will sustain. Route A will allow heavy trucks to average 35 miles/hour, while the other vehicles can maintain 45 miles/hour. For each of Routes B and C, these numbers are 40 miles/hour for heavy trucks and 50 miles/hour for other vehicles. The cost of time for all commercial traffic is valued at $25/hour and for noncommercial vehicles, $10/hour. Twenty-five percent of the automobiles and all of the trucks are considered commercial.</p> <p class="blog">Finally, there is a significant safety factor to be included. An excessive number of accidents per year have occurred along the old winding road. Route A will reduce the number of vehicles involved in accidents to 105, and Routes B and C are expected to involve only 75 and 50 vehicles in accidents, respectively. The average cost per vehicle in an accident is estimated to be $18,000, considering actual property damages, lost time and wages, medical expenses, and other relevant costs.</p> <p class="blog">The Washington planners want to compare the three alternative routes using benefit-cost criteria, specifically the popular benefit-cost ratio.</p>

The benefi t-cost analysis includes the government fi rst costs, resurfacing costs, and maintenance costs plus the public operational, time, and accident costs that follow.<br /> Annual public operational costs are:<br /> Route A: [(350)(0.70) + (250)(1.10) + (80)(0.30) + (3,320)(0.60)]<br /> (26)(365) = $24,066,640/year<br /> Route B: [(350)(0.70) + (250)(1.10) + (80)(0.30) + (3320)(0.60)]<br /> (22)(365) = $20,364,080/yr<br /> Route C: [(350)(0.70) + (250)(1.10) + (80)(0.30) + (3320)(0.60)]<br /> (20.5)(365) = $18,975,620/yr<br /> Annual public time costs:<br /> Route A: [(350)(1/45)(25) + (250)(1/35)(25) + (80)(1/45)(10)<br /> + (3,320)(0.25)(1/45)(25) + (3,320)(0.75)(1/45)(10)]<br /> (26)(365) = $13,335,710/year<br /> Route B: [(350)(1/50)(25) + (250)(1/40)(25) + (80)(1/50)(10)<br /> + (3,320)(0.25)(1/50))(25) + (3,320)(0.75)(1/50)(10)]<br /> (22)(365) = $10,119,808/year<br /> Route C: [(350)(1/50)(25) + (250)(1/40)(25) + (80)(1/50)(10)<br /> + (3,320)(0.25)(1/50))(25) + (3,320)(0.75)(1/50)(10)](20.5)(365) = $9,429,821/year<br /> Annual accident costs per vehicle:<br /> Route A: (105)(18,000) = $1,890,000/year<br /> Route B: (75)(18,000) = $1,350,000/year<br /> Route C: (50)(18,000) = $900,000/year<br /> All relevant government and public costs are summarized in Figure 4.7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since planners have not yet defined the “benefits” per se, public benefits are taken as the incremental reduction in user costs between each pair of alternatives evaluated. Then, the incremental benefits are compared against the respective incremental costs needed to achieve the incremental benefits.<br /> The incremental benefits and costs for Route B as compared to Route A using a real discount rate of 8 percent are given as follows:<br /> Δ<span class="tex-text">\(B_{B-A}\)</span>(8%) = Public <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{A}\)</span>(8%)- Public <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{B}\)</span>(8%) $39,292,350- $31,833,888 = $7,458,462<br /> Δ<span class="tex-text">\(C_{B-A}\)</span>(8%) = Government <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{B}\)</span>(8%) &#8211; Government <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{A}\)</span>(8%)<br /> $8,775,501 &#8211; $8,009,533 = $765,968<br /> That is, for an incremental expenditure of $765,968/year, the government can provide added benefits of $7,458,462/year for the public. The appropriate benefit-cost ratio is then</p>
 <p class="blog">
ΔB/<span class="tex-text">\(C_{B-A}\)</span>(8%) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\Delta B_{B-A}(8 \%)}{\Delta C_{B-A}(8 \%)} \)</span>= <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{ \$7,458,462}{ \$ 765,968}\)</span> = 9.74</p>
 <p class="blog">
This clearly indicates that the additional funds for Route B are worthwhile,<br /> and Route B is desired over Route A.<br /> Using a similar analysis, the benefits, costs, and ΔB/C ratio may now be calculated to determine whether or not Route C is preferable to Route B:<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B_{C-B}\)</span>(8%) = Public <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{B}\)</span>(8%) &#8211; Public <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{C}\)</span>(8%)<br /> $31,833,888- $29,305,441 = $2,528,447<br /> Δ<span class="tex-text">\(C_{C-B}\)</span>(8%) = Government <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{C}\)</span>(8%) &#8211; Government <span class="tex-text">\(costs_{B}\)</span>(8%)<br /> $10,162,134 &#8211; $8,775,501 = $1,386,633<br /> Δ<span class="tex-text">\(B_{C-B}\)</span>(8%) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\Delta B_{C-B}(8 \%)} {\Delta C_{B-A}(8 \%)}\)</span> =<span class="tex-text">\(\frac {\$ 2,528,447}{\$ 1,386,633}\)</span> = 1.82<br /> This benefit-cost ratio, being greater than 1.00, shows that the additional expenditure of $1,386,633/year to build and maintain Route C would provide commensurate benefits in public savings of $2,528,447/year. Of the three alternatives, Route C is preferred.<br /> Figure 4.8 illustrates the benefit-cost calculations using Excel®.</p>
