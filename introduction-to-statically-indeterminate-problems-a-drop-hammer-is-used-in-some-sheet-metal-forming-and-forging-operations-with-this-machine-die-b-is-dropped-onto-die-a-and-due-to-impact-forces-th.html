            <p class="blog">Introduction to Statically Indeterminate Problems</p> <p class="blog">A drop hammer is used in some sheet metal forming and forging operations. With this machine, die B is dropped onto die A, and due to impact forces, the workpiece between A and B is hammered into the shape of the cavity or die between them. Both dies A and B slide on low-friction fixed vertical bars so they maintain proper alignment. Special coil springs CD and EF , called <em>die springs</em>, are used to help isolate the severe vibrations of the dies from being transmitted to the floor that supports the machine.</p> <p class="blog">The user of the machine determines that additional stiffness is needed for vibration isolation. Although the die springs could be replaced with heavier springs, this requires disassembly of the machine. Rather, additional vertical springs such as GH and IJ are more easily added and removed when they are no longer needed. The springs have stiffnesses <span class="tex-text">\(k_{1} = 5000 {lb}/{in.}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(k_{2} = 1500 {lb}/{in.}\)</span>. If all springs are unstretched when δ = 0, determine the deflection δ if die A is subjected to a downward vertical force P = 1 kip.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/01/Capture39.png"></div>

<strong>Road Map</strong> A solution to this problem will require as many equations as there are unknowns. As described in the margin note, the equations of equilibrium alone are not sufficient in number, and additional equations must be added that describe the behavior of the springs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling</strong> Assuming the vertical guides allow die A to undergo only vertical motion with no rotation, both springs at the bottom of A are compressed by the same amount, and hence develop the same force <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span>. Similarly, both springs on the sides of A develop the same force <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span>. Idealizing die A as a particle allows the FBD shown in Fig. 2 to be drawn, where <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span> are taken to be positive in compression and tension, respectively.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Equilibrium Equations</strong> The equilibrium equation for A is</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_{y} } =0: 2Q_{1} + 2Q_{2} &#8211; P =0\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since no forces act in the x direction, the equation <span class="tex-text">\(\sum{F_{y} } =0\)</span> is automatically satisfied regardless of the values for <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span>, <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span> and P, and hence this equation provides no useful information.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equation (1) is unlike any we have encountered thus far in this book. Even though P = 1 kip, there remain two unknowns and only one equation with which to determine them. Such a problem has no unique solution. Rather, there are an infinite number of solutions for <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span> that will satisfy Eq. (1). We call such problems statically indeterminate, because the equations of static equilibrium alone are not sufficient to determine the unknowns. To obtain the appropriate solution among the infinite number of solutions that are possible, additional information is needed. In this problem, this information corresponds to descriptions of the deformability of the springs, which we address next.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Force Laws</strong> Since all the springs are uncompressed when δ = 0 , the first form of Eq. (3.18) on p. 137 allows us to write for each set of springs</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{s} = k\delta\)</span></p>
 <p style="padding-left: 80px"><span class="tex-text">\(=k \left(L &#8211; L_{0} \right)\)</span> (3.18)</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} = k_{1} \delta = \left({5000 lb}/{in.}\right) \delta\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} = k_{2} \delta = \left({1500 lb}/{in.}\right) \delta\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In writing Eq. (2), <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span> is positive in compression and positive δ gives contraction of the springs at the base. Hence, the negative signs associated with each of these quantities, compared to our normal convention of spring force being positive in tension and spring deformation being positive in extension, compensate one another.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Computation</strong> Combining Eqs. (1)–(3) provides</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(2\left(5000 \frac{lb}{in} + 1500 \frac{lb}{in} \right) \delta &#8211; P =0\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
With P = 1000 lb, we now have one equation and one unknown, and Eq. (4) may be solved for</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(\delta = 0\cdot 0769 in.\)</span> (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once δ is known, if desired, we may return to Eqs. (2) and (3) to determine the portion of the force P that is supported by each spring to obtain</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px"><span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} = 385 lb\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} = 115 lb\)</span> (6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion &amp; Verification</strong> We expect the die to move downward, and hence our solution should show δ &gt; 0 , which it does. We expect springs CD and EF to be in compression, and since <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} \)</span> was defined to be positive in compression, our solution should show<span class="tex-text">\( Q_{1} \gt 0\)</span> , which it does. Similarly, we expect springs GH and IJ to be in tension, and since <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} \)</span> was defined to be positive in tension, our solution should show <span class="tex-text">\( Q_{2} \gt 0\)</span>, which it does. After these simple checks, we should verify that our solutions for δ, <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} \)</span> satisfy all governing equations, which consist of the equilibrium equation, Eq. (1), and the force laws, Eqs. (2) and (3).</p>

Helpful Information</p>
 <p class="blog">
Statically indeterminate structures. A characteristic of a statically indeterminate structure is that there are extra “load paths” available to support the applied loads. In this example, the springs at the base, by themselves, are adequate to support the applied loads, and equations of equilibrium will determine exactly what value of force they must support. Conversely, the springs on the sides, by themselves, are also adequate to support the applied loads, and equations of equilibrium will determine exactly what value of force they must support. With both sets of springs present, it is unclear from the equations of equilibrium alone what portions of the applied force are supported by each set of springs. Either set of springs could be viewed as providing an extra load path.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Static indeterminacy makes analysis more difﬁcult, but is often a desirable feature to have in structures. For example, if one load path in a statically indeterminate structure is lost because of an accident or failure, the remaining load paths may be sufﬁcient for the structure to remain in static equilibrium. Static indeterminacy is studied in greater detail in later chapters of this book.</p>
