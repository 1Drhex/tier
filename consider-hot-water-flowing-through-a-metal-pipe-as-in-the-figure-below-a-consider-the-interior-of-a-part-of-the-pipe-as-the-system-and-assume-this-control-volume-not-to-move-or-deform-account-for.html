a) We are dealing with a stationary control volume (CV) through which water and entropy are flowing. (See the upper part of Fig. Ex.1; water is flowing from left to right.) We have to find the currents flowing through the control surface and determine the fluxes associated with them.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First of all, entropy must be flowing radially outward through the pipe if the surroundings are cooler than the water. This means that we have a conductive current of entropy penetrating the cylindrical surface. Since the flow is outward, its flux will have a negative sign (symbolized by an arrow in the negative x-direction).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Second, because of the loss of heat through the walls of the pipe, the water entering the control volume will be warmer than the water leaving. We have a thermal driving force in the direction parallel to the axis of the pipe. At the control surface, there must be conductive currents of entropy through the water in its direction of flow. Therefore, we have a positive flux associated with the conductive current at the entrance to the control volume (left), and a negative flux due to the current leaving the system.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, two convective fluxes are associated with the flow of water into and out of the control volume. Entropy stored in the water is carried across the surface of the system. Again the flux is positive at the inlet, and negative at the outlet. The flux at the entrance is larger in magnitude than the one at the outlet.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) If we follow a certain body of water in its motion, the system wall moves with it (lower part of Fig. Ex.1). Water does not flow across the surface of the body, which is represented by the shaded area. This means that there are no convective currents of entropy to be considered. The conductive currents still exist, and they are the same as the ones identified in (a).</p>
