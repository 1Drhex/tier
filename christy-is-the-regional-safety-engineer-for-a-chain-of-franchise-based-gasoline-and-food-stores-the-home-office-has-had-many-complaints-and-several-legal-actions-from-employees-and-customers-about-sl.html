            <p class="blog">Christy is the regional safety engineer for a chain of franchise-based gasoline and food stores. The home office has had many complaints and several legal actions from employees and customers about slips and falls due to liquids (water, oil, gas, soda, etc.) on concrete surfaces.Corporate management has authorized each regional engineer to contract locally to apply to all exterior concrete surfaces a newly marketed product that absorbs up to 100 times its own weight in liquid and to charge a home office account for the installation. The authorizing letter to Christy states that, based upon their simulation and random samples that assume a normal population, the cost of the locally arranged installation should be about $10,000 and almost always is within the range of $8000 to $12,000.<br /> Since Christy has a BS in applied math and you have a BS in engineering, you have been asked to write a brief but thorough summary about the normal distribution, explain the $8000 to $12,000 range statement, and explain the phrase “random samples that assume a normal population.”</p>

The following summaries about the normal distribution and sampling will help explain the authorization letter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Normal distribution, probabilities, and random samples</strong><br /> The normal distribution is also referred to as the bell-shaped curve, the Gaussian distribution, or the error distribution. It is, by far, the most commonly used probability distribution in all applications. It places exactly one-half of the probability on either side of the mean or expected value. It is used for continuous variables over the entire range of numbers. The normal distribution is found to accurately predict many types of outcomes, such as IQ values; manufacturing errors about a specified size, volume, weight, etc.; and the distribution of sales revenues, costs, and many other business parameters around a specified mean, which is why it may apply in this situation.<br /> The normal distribution, identified by the symbol <span class="tex-text">\(N(\mu,\sigma ^{2}\)</span>, where ? is the expected value or mean and <span class="tex-text">\( \sigma ^{2}\)</span> is the variance, or measure of spread, can be described as follows:<br /> • The mean ? locates the probability distribution (Figure 19–10a), and the spread of the distribution varies with variance (Figure 19–10b), growing wider and flatter for larger variance values.<br /> • When a sample is taken, the estimates are identified as sample mean <span class="tex-text">\(\overline{X}\)</span> for ? and sample standard deviation s for ?.<br /> • The normal probability distribution f(X) for a variable X is quite complicated because its formula is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(f(X)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi } } \exp \left\{-\left[\frac{(X-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}} \right] \right\} \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
where exp represents the number e = 2.71828.<br /> Since f(X) is so unwieldy, random samples and probability statements are developed using a<br /> transformation, called the standard normal distribution (SND), which uses ? and ? (population) or <span class="tex-text">\(\overline{X}\)</span> and s (sample) to compute values of the varia</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Population : <span class="tex-text">\( Z = \frac{deviation from mean}{standard deviation} =\frac{ X − \mu} {\sigma }\)</span> &#8230;&#8230;..[19.17]</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Sample: <span class="tex-text">\(Z = \frac{X -\overline{X}}{s }\)</span>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;[19.18]</p>
 <p class="blog">
The SND for Z (Figure 19–10c) is the same as for X, except that it always has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and it is identified by the symbol N(0,1). Therefore, the probability values under the SND curve can be stated exactly. It is always possible to transfer back to the original values from sample data by solving Equation [19.17] for X:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">X = Z? + ? &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.[19.19]</p>
 <p class="blog">
Several probability statements for Z and X are summarized in the following table and are shown<br /> on the distribution curve for Z in Figure 19–10c.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table > <table style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 162pt" border="0" width="216" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td style="height: 14.25pt;width: 54pt" width="72" height="19"><strong>Variable X Range</strong></td> <td style="width: 54pt" width="72"><strong>Probability</strong></td> <td style="width: 54pt" width="72"><strong>Variable Z Range</strong></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ+1σ</td> <td>0.3143</td> <td>0 to +1</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ±1σ</td> <td>0.6826</td> <td>-1 to +1</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ+2σ</td> <td>0.4773</td> <td>0 to +2</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td class="xl66" style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ±2σ</td> <td class="xl66">0.9546</td> <td class="xl66">-2 to +2</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td class="xl65" style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ+3σ</td> <td class="xl65">0.4987</td> <td class="xl65">0 to +3</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td style="height: 14.25pt" height="19">μ±3σ</td> <td>0.9974</td> <td>-3 to +3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> </table> <p class="blog">
As an illustration, probability statements from this tabulation and Figure 19–10c for X and Z<br /> are as follows:<br /> The probability that X is within 2? of its mean is 0.9546.<br /> The probability that Z is within 2? of its mean, which is the same as between the values −2 and +2, is also 0.9546.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In order to take a random sample from a normal<span class="tex-text">\( N(\mu,\sigma ^{2})\)</span> population, a specially prepared table of SND random numbers is used. (Tables of SND values are available in many statistics books.) The numbers are actually values from the Z or N(0,1) distribution and have values such as −2.10,<br /> +1.24, etc. Translation from the Z value back to the sample values for X is via Equation [19.19].</p>

<strong>Interpretation of the home office memo</p>
 <p class="blog">
</strong>The statement that virtually all the local contract amounts should be between $8000 and $12,000 may be interpreted as follows: A normal distribution is assumed with a mean of μ = $10,000 and a standard deviation for ? = $667, or a variance of <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma^{2}= (\$667)^{2}\)</span>; that is, an <span class="tex-text">\(N[\$10,000, (\$667)^{2}] \)</span>distribution is assumed. The value ? = $667 is calculated using the fact that virtually all the probability (99.74%) is within 3? of the mean, as stated above. Therefore,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">3? = $2000 and ? = $667 (rounded off)</p>
 <p class="blog">
As an illustration, if six SND random numbers are selected and used to take a sample of size 6 from the normal distribution <span class="tex-text">\(N[\$10,000, (\$667)^{2}]\)</span>, the results are as follows:</p>
