            <p class="blog">Minimizing a Salesperson’s Distance Traveled<br /> Willie Lowman is a salesman who lives in Boston. He needs to visit each of the cities listed in Figure 8.29 (see below) and then return to Boston. What route should Willie use to minimize the total distance traveled?<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To use Evolutionary Solver, with an “alldifferent” constraint, to find the shortest route that starts and ends in Boston and visits each of the other 10 cities exactly once.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The numbers in this example could be found from a map. In general, the required data are the distances from each city to each other city, where distance can be interpreted as a cost. For example, if Willie is flying from city to city, the costs of the various flights is the more relevant “distance” measure, and these costs are not necessarily proportional to the actual distances.</p>

As indicated in Figure 8.28 (see the file Traveling Salesperson Big Picture.xlsx), this problem is surprisingly easy to model. You simply need a way to specify that any potential solution is a permutation of the numbers 1 through 10. Fortunately, this is exactly what Evolutionary Solver’s alldifferent constraint does. You constrain the indexes of the cities visited to be between 1 and 10, and you also constrain them to be all different. Of course, the only way this can occur is if they are a permutation of the numbers 1 through 10. With this in mind, the model is straightforward. (Actually, you don’t even need to constrain the indexes to be between 1 and 10. When Solver sees that the “alldifferent” range has 10 cells, it automatically searches for permutations of the integers 1 to 10.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed model appears in the file Traveling Salesperson Finished.xlsx and Figure 8.29. It can be developed with the following steps:<br /> 1) Distance matrix. Enter the distance matrix in the light blue range.<br /> 2) Index cities. The cities need to be referenced by numerical indexes rather than names, so enter appropriate indexes in the range B19:B29. These indexes are based on alphabetical order, but any order could be used. Still, it is convenient to index the home city, Boston, as 0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Specify route. Enter any route in the Route range. Note that 0 is entered in cells D19 and D30 because the route must start and end in Boston. However, the numbers in between can be any permutation of the integers 1 through 10. (Even this isn’t necessary. You can enter any initial values in these 10 cells.) This Route range becomes the decision variable range.<br /> 4) Calculate distances. To calculate the distances on the various legs of the trip, you can use the INDEX function to perform a lookup in the distance matrix. Specifically, enter the formula<br /> =INDEX(Distance_matrix,D19+1,D20+1)<br /> in cell E20 and copy it down to cell E30. This formula looks up the appropriate distance in the distance matrix. (The 11s are necessary because the cities are indexed from 0 to 10, not from 1 to 11.) Then calculate the total distance in cell B32 with the SUM function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function: INDEX</strong><br /> The function INDEX, using the syntax INDEX (range,row,column), is used to return the value in a given row and column of a specified range. For example, INDEX (A5:C10,3,2) returns the value in the third row and second column of the range A5:C10, that is, the value in cell B7. If the given range is a single row, the row argument can be omitted. If the given range is a single column, the column argument can be omitted.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box should be set up as shown in Figure 8.30. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled, subject to the constraints that all indexes on the route (other than Boston’s) are between 1 and 10, and they must be all different. Specifying this “AllDifferent” constraint is similar to specifying an integer or binary constraint. When you choose Evolutionary Solver, a “dif” option is available when you add a constraint. (See Figure 8.31.) It is useful in exactly this type of model, where the numbers in a permutation must all be different.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution appears in Figure 8.29. Willie should go from Boston to New York to Pittsburgh to Chicago to Denver to Seattle to San Francisco to Los Angeles to Phoenix to Dallas to Miami and finally to Boston. Essentially, Willie should travel around the country in a counter clockwise manner. The distance of this route is 8995 miles. Is this solution unique? It definitely is not. Willie could travel in a clockwise direction instead: Boston to Miami to Dallas and so on. Because the distance matrix is symmetric, this clockwise route is bound to have the same total distance as the counterclockwise route.</p>
