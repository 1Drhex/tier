            <p class="blog">An engineer and a medical doctor have teamed up to develop a major improvement in laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder operations. They formed a small business corporation to handle the financial aspects of their partnership. The company has invested $500,000 in the project already this year (t = 0),and it expects to spend $500,000 annually for the next 4 years, and possibly for more years. Develop a spreadsheet that helps answer the following questions.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Assume the $500,000 is expended for only 4 additional years. If the company sells the rights to use the new technology at the end of year 5 for $5 million, what is the anticipated rate of return?</p> <p class="blog">(b) The engineer and doctor estimate that they will need $500,000 per year for more than 4 additional years. How many years from now do they have to finish their development work and receive the $5 million license fee to make at least 10% per year? Assume the $500,000 per year is expended through the year immediately prior to the receipt for the $5 million .</p>

Solution by Computer<br /> Figure 2-22 presents the spreadsheet, with all financial values in $1000 units. The IRR function is used throughout.<br /> (a) The function lRR(B6:Bll) in cell B15 displays i = 24.07%. Note there is a cash flow of $-500 in year 0. The equivalence statement is: Spending $500,000 now and $500,000 each year for 4 more years is equivalent to receiving $5 million at the end of year 5, when the interest rate is 24.07% per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Find the rate of return for an increasing number of years that the $500 is expended. Columns C and D in Figure 2- 22 present the results of IRR functions with the $5000 cash flow in different years. Cells C15 and D15 show returns on opposite sides of 10%. Therefore, the $5 million must be received some time prior to the end of year 7 to make more than the 8.93% shown in cell D15 . The engineer and doctor have less than 6 years to complete their development work.</p>
