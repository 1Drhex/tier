            <p class="blog">HRD owns a number of small hotels. The room occupancy rate varies significantly from month to month. There are also high fixed costs. As a result, the cash generated each month has been very difficult to estimate.<br /> Christmas is normally a busy period and large cash surpluses are expected in December. There is, however, a possibility that a rival group of hotels will offer large discounts in December and this could damage December trade for HRD to a significant extent.<br /> January is a poor period for the industry and therefore all the entity’s hotels will close for the month, resulting in a negative cash flow. The Finance Director has identified the following possible outcomes and their associated probabilities:<br /> . $000s Probability<br /> Expected cash balance at 30 November 2002 +175 1.0<br /> Net operating cash flow in December 2002 + 700 0.7<br /> . -300 0.3<br /> Net operating cash flow in January 2003 -900 1.0<br /> Assume cash flows arise at month ends.<br /> Money can be put on deposit at the following rates:<br /> Maturity period Compounded annualised yield<br /> 1 month 5% (i.e. 0.4074% per month)<br /> 2 months 6% (i.e. 0.9759% for two months)<br /> The entity’s overdraft carries a compounded annualised interest rate of 10% (i.e. 0.7974%<br /> per month).<br /> After January 2003, trade is expected to improve, but there is still a high degree of uncertainty in relation to the cash surpluses or deficits that will be generated in each month.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Calculate the expected cash balance or overdraft of HRD at 31 January 2003. Briefly comment, with reasons, on whether this figure should be used for short-term cash planning.<br /> (b) As a member of the treasury team of HRD, write a memorandum to the Directors, with supporting calculations, advising them regarding the investment of short-term cash balance is December 2002 and January 2003. Ignore transaction costs and make all calculations to the nearest $1.<br /> (c) Consider whether the use of the Miller-Orr model would be useful for determining HRD’s policy for investment of short-term cash balances beyond January 2003. Calculations are not required.</p>

The expected balance at 31 January is an overdraft of $325,000. This, however, provides a poor basis for planning, as this particular outcome will not occur.<br /> This is because, based on the probabilities provided, there will either be cash inflow of $700,000 in December or a cash outflow of $300,000. The mean expected value would only be relevant if the event could be repeated a significant number of times. The basis of planning should thus be for each of the two possible outcomes.<br /> Examiner’s Note:<br /> The above calculations exclude interest paid/received. However, these could be included (see calculations to requirement (b)), but the overall conclusions with respect to the use of the mean expected value would be unchanged.<br /> (b)<br /> Memorandum<br /> To: The Board From: Treasury assistant<br /> Subject: Investment of short term cash balances Date: 19 November 2002<br /> Two possibilities arise with respect to trading in December:<br /> ● Favourable conditions (70% probability)<br /> ● Rival chain discounts (30% probability)<br /> The impact on operating cash flows is as follows:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="217"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89"></td> <td width="64">$000</td> <td width="64">$000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Opening balance (1/12/2002)</td> <td>175</td> <td>175</td> </tr> <tr> <td>December</td> <td>700</td> <td>-300</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January</td> <td>-900</td> <td>-900</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Closing balance (31/1/2003)</td> <td>-25</td> <td>-1,025</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
In either case there is no surplus cash at the end of January, so there is no point investing beyond two months (that is 31 January 2003).<br /> The choices are thus:<br /> Option 1. Invest $175,000 for one month. Then $875,000 (plus interest on the $175,000 initial<br /> investment) for a further month if conditions are favourable, or borrow $125,000 (less interest on the $175,000 initial investment) in the second month if conditions are unfavourable.<br /> Option 2. Invest $175,000 for two months. Then a further $700,000 for a further month if conditions are favourable and borrow $300,000 in the second month if conditions are unfavourable.<br /> Unfortunately.</p>

Option 2. Invest $175,000 for two months. Then a further $700,000 for a further month if conditions are favourable and borrow $300,000 in the second month if conditions are unfavourable.<br /> Unfortunately, under option 2, if conditions are unfavourable, then the initial investment will need to be financed by overdraft in the second month at an annualised rate of 10% as opposed to the amount earned of 6%.<br /> Specifically, the interest rates are:</p>
 <p class="blog">
One month deposit <span class="tex-text">\((1.05)^{1/12} \)</span>&#8211; 1= 0.004074<br /> Two month deposit<span class="tex-text">\( (1.06)^{2/12}\)</span> &#8211; 1= 0.009759</p>
 <p class="blog">
One month overdraft <span class="tex-text">\((1.10)^{1/12}\)</span> &#8211; 1 = 0.007974<br /> Option 1<br /> . $<br /> Invest $175,000 for 1 month (0.004074 × 175,000) 713<br /> Then either:<br /> (1) invest $875,713 for 1 month (0.004074 × 875,713) × 70% 2,497<br /> (2) overdraft of $124,287 1 month (0.007974 × 124,287) × 30% -297<br /> . 2,913<br /> Option 2<br /> . $<br /> Invest $175,000 for 2 months (0.009759 × 175,000) 1,708<br /> Then either:<br /> (1) $700,000 for 1 month (0.004074 × 700,000) × 70% 1,996<br /> (2) overdraft of $300,00 for 1 month (0.007974 × 300,000) × 30% -717<br /> . 2,987</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before a final decision can be taken however a number of other factors should be considered. Expected values ignore risk. Thus, in Option 2, there is a significant loss due to overdraft interest if trading is unfavourable in December. While only having a 30% probability this may be regarded as risking additional financial cost at a time of high operating<br /> losses.<br /> Transactions costs would reduce the benefit of both options, as in each case there are two deposits.<br /> The scale of the existing overdraft needs to be considered. This is particularly the case if the entity is nearing its overdraft facility. This would favour Option 1 where the deposit maturing could be used to reduce the overdraft necessary in January 2003.<br /> (c)<br /> The Miller Orr model assumes that cash flows are entirely unpredictable. This is consistent with the uncertainty that appears to exist for HRD after January 2003.<br /> The model sets lower and upper bounds for the cash balance.<br /> When cash falls to the lower level, investments are sold to return cash to a pre-determined level – called the return point.<br /> When cash balances rise to the upper level, the treasurer will buy short-term investments to return cash down to the return point.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The lower limit is set by management. The return point and the upper limit are then set by the model based on the formula for the spread between the upper and lower limits.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( 3\times \left[\frac{3/4 \times transaction costs \times variance of daily cashflows}{Interest rate} \right] ^{1/3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Thus, if variability of cash flows increase so does the spread. Variations can however take into account seasonality (for example for HRD’s Ltd’s Christmas or Holiday trade peaks) different accounts, lead times and so on.<br /> There are, however, a number of problems in applying the Miller-Orr model to HRD Ltd:<br /> ● The model assumes cash flows are random whereas there appears to be some predictability in HRD’s cash movements. Some costs are known. Also, even sales can be estimated, though only with probabilities attached.<br /> ● The difficult trading conditions appear to imply that, as with many entities, a hard core overdraft will be maintained for much of the year, leaving no available surplus cash balances to implement the model.</p>
