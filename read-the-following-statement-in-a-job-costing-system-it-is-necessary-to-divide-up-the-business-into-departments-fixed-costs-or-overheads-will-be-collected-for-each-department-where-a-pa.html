            <p class="blog">Read the following statement: ‘In a job costing system, it is necessary to divide up the business into departments. Fixed costs (or overheads) will be collected for each department. Where a particular fixed cost relates to the business as a whole, it must be divided between the departments. Usually this is done on the basis of area of floor space occupied by each department relative to the entire business.When the total fixed costs for each department have been identified, this will be divided by the number of hours that were worked in each department to deduce an overhead recovery rate. Each job that was worked on in a department will have a share of fixed costs allotted to it according to how long it was worked on. The total cost for each job will therefore be the sum of the variable costs of the job and its share of the fixed costs. It is essential that this approach is taken in order to deduce a selling price for the business’s output.’</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong>: Prepare a table of two columns. In the first column you should show any phrases or sentences in the above statement with which you do not agree, and in the second column you should show your reason for disagreeing with each one.</p>

They are not really connected with one another. ‘Fixed’ is to do with how costs behave as the level of output is raised or lowered; ‘overheads’ are to do with the extent to which costs can be directly measured in respect of a particular unit of output. Though it is true that many overheads are fixed, not all are. Also, direct labour is usually a fixed cost.</p>

All of the other references to fixed and variable costs are wrong. The person should have referred to indirect and direct costs.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">‘Usually this is done on the basis of area’</td> <td width="355">Where overheads are apportioned to departments, they will be apportioned on some logical basis. For certain costs – for example, rent – the floor area may be the most logical; for others, such as machine maintenance costs, the floor area would be totally inappropriate.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">‘When the total fixed costs for each department have</p>

been identified, this will be divided by the number of hours that were worked’</td> <td width="355">Where overheads are dealt with on a departmental basis, they may be divided by the number of direct labour hours to deduce a recovery rate. However, this is only one basis of applying overheads to jobs. For example, machine hours or some other basis may be more appropriate to the particular circumstances involved.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">‘It is essential that this approach is taken in order to deduce a selling price’</td> <td width="355">It is relatively unusual for the ‘job cost’ to be able to dictate the price at which the manufacturer can price its output For many businesses, the market dictates the price.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
