            <p class="blog">The Scott and White Health Plan (SWHP) has purchased a robotized prescription fulfillment system for faster and more accurate delivery to patients with stable, pill-form medication for chronic health problems, such as diabetes, thyroid, and high blood pressure. Assume this high volume system costs $3 million to install and an estimated $200,000 per year for all materials, operating, personnel, and maintenance costs. The expected life is 10 years. An SWHP biomedical engineer wants to estimate the total revenue requirement for each 6-month period that is necessary to recover the investment, interest, and annual costs. Find this semiannual A value both by hand and by spreadsheet, if capital funds are evaluated at 8% per year, using two different compounding periods:</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Rate 1</strong>. 8% per year, compounded semiannually.<br /> <strong>Rate 2.</strong> 8% per year, compounded monthly.</p>

Figure 4–7 shows the cash flow diagram. Throughout the 20 semiannual periods, the annual cost occurs every other period, and the capital recovery series is sought for every 6-month period. This pattern makes the solution by hand quite involved if the<em> P∕A</em> and <em>A∕P</em> factors are used to find <em>P</em> and <em>A</em> values. The spreadsheet solution is recommended in cases such as this.<br /> Solution by hand—rate 1: Steps to find the semiannual <em>A</em> value are as follows. First, calculate the present worth <em>P</em> at time 0 with <em>n</em> = 10 years using the effective annual rate.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(Effective i per year =\left\lgroup1+0.08/ 2 \right\rgroup ^{2}-1=8.16\%\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P = 3,000,000 + 200,000(P/A,8.16%,10)<br /> = 3,000,000 + 200,000(6.6619)<br /> = $4,332,380</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, find A per 6-month period.<br /> PP = CP at 6 months; find the effective rate per semiannual period.<br /> Effective semiannual <em>i</em> = 8%∕2 = 4% per 6 months, compounded semiannually. Number of semiannual periods n = 2(10) = 20.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">A = $4,332,380(A∕P,4%,20) = $318,777 per 6-months</p>
 <p class="blog">
Conclusion: Revenue of $318,777 is necessary every 6 months to cover all costs and interest at 8% per year, compounded semiannually.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Solution by hand—rate 2</em>: As before, calculate <em>P</em> at time 0 with <em>n</em> = 10 years and an effective annual year for monthly compounding.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(Effective i per year=\left\lgroup1+0.08/ 12 \right\rgroup ^{12}-1=8.30\%\)</span><br /> P = 3,000,000 + 200,000(P/A,8.30%,10)<br /> = 3,000,000 + 200,000(6.6202)<br /> = $4,324,040</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, find A per semiannual period, where<br /> PP is 6 months, but the CP is monthly; therefore, PP &gt; CP. To find the effective semiannual rate, the effective interest rate Equation [4.7] <span class="tex-text">\(Effective i per time period = \left\lgroup 1 + \frac{ r}{m}\right\rgroup ^{m} − 1 \)</span> is applied with<em> r</em> = 4% and <em>m</em> = 6 months per semiannual period. The <em>n</em> value to determine <em>A</em> is 20 semiannual periods.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(Effective semiannual i=\left\lgroup1+\frac{0.04}{6} \right\rgroup ^{6}-1=4.067\%\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">A = $4,324,080(A∕P,4.067%,20) = $320,061 per 6-months</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, $320,061, or $1284 more semiannually, is required to cover the more frequent compounding of the 8% per year interest. Note that all <em>P∕A</em> and <em>A∕P</em> factors must be calculated with factor formulas at 8.30% and 4.067%, respectively. This method is usually more calculation intensive and error-prone than the spreadsheet solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Solution by spreadsheet—rates 1 and 2</em>: Once the effective interest rates per semiannual period have been determined, a spreadsheet solution is simple. For rate 1, a single-cell PMT function, with an imbedded PV function (in italics) to determine the present worth of the $200,000 annual series at the effective annual rate of 8.16%, displays A = $318,784 per 6-month period.<br /> The function is:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= PMT(4%,20,PV(8.16%,10,200000) − 3000000)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Similarly, for rate 2, the single-cell spreadsheet function = PMT(4.067%,20,PV(8.30%,10,200000)–3000000) displays A = $320,061 per 6-month period. Note that the EFFECT function can be used separately or incorporated into these single-cell PMT functions to calculate the effective rates necessary to determine the correct semiannual A values.<br /> A spreadsheet can also be used if the $200,000 annual amounts are considered single amounts, but the spreadsheet is more involved as follows. Figure 4–8 presents a general solution for the problem at both rates. (Several rows at the bottom of the spreadsheet are not printed.<br /> They continue the cash flow pattern of $200,000 every other 6 months through cell B32.) The functions in C8 and E8 are general expressions for the effective rate per PP, expressed in months. This allows some sensitivity analysis to be performed for different PP and CP values.<br /> Note the functions in C7 and E7 to determine m for the effective rate relations. This technique works well for spreadsheets once PP and CP are entered in the time unit of the CP.<br /> Each 6-month period is included in the cash flows, including the $0 entries, so the NPV and PMT functions work correctly. The final A values in D14 ($318,784) and F14 ($320,069) are slightly different than those of the hand solution due to the number of significant digits used by spreadsheet functions.<br /> The EFFECT function is applied in cells C8 and E8 to obtain the effective semiannual rate i. When using EFFECT for payment periods other than a year, the first entry of “nominal_rate” is the rate per payment period, not per year as indicated in Equation [4.5] the effective annual rate= EFFECT(r%,m). In the case for rate #2, the percentage is per 6-month payment period, that is, 4%, as determined in cell E8 using the relation E2/2. EFFECT correctly displays the effective semiannual rate of 4.07%.</p>
