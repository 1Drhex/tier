            <p class="blog">Scheduling Flights at TriCities Airlines</p> <p class="blog">TriCities Airlines flies several daily commuter flights to and from New York City, Washington,<br /> D.C., and Boston. The company has been flying a fixed daily schedule of flights, but it is now deciding whether to change this schedule. Each potential flight has an estimated net revenue based on the typical number of passengers for the flight. (Look ahead to Figure 5.35 for a listing of all potential flights and their net revenues.) The company owns four airplanes, and it does not anticipate buying any more. There is a fixed cost of $1500 per plane per day that flies any flights. However, a plane that is not used does not incur this fixed cost. We assume (although this could be relaxed) that there is no required delay time on the ground; therefore, if a flight arrives in Boston at time 10, it can leave on<br /> a new flight at time 10. (Time is measured in 24-hour military time.) Also, any plane that arrives in a city after its last flight of the day has two options. It can sit overnight in that city, or, at a cost of $500, it can be flown empty to another city overnight. The company’s objective is to maximize its net profit per day, which equals net revenues from flights flown, minus fixed costs of flying planes, minus overnight costs of flying empty.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To develop a network model for scheduling the airline’s flights, given its available aircraft, to maximize net profit from the flights.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> In a real setting, the airline would first have to decide which flights, including flight times, to include in the potential list of flights. This is presumably based on customer demands. The financial inputs are obtained from accounting records. For example, the net revenue for a flight is based on the number of passengers who typically take the flight, ticket prices,personnel costs, and fuel costs. The fixed cost of operating a plane includes any costs that do not depend directly on the amount of time the plane spends in the air.</p>

We first discuss how this problem can be modeled as a network flow model, which is certainly not obvious. The trick is to have a node for each city/time combination. Because flights are allowed on the half-hour, this means having nodes of the form Boston8, Boston8.5, and so on, up to WashDC20 (assuming that the earliest flight leaves at time 8 and the latest flight arrives at time 20). There are three types of arcs. The most obvious type is a flight arc. For example, if there is a flight from Boston at time 12.5 that arrives at Washington, D.C., at time 14, then there is a flight arc from node Boston12.5 to node WashDC14. The flow on such an arc represents the number of planes that fly this flight. Because each flight can be flown at most once, a capacity of 1 is imposed on all such flight arcs. The “cost” on a flight arc is the net revenue for flying the flight. (In this model, it is more natural to use net revenues as the arc “costs,” so that the objective will be to maximize net profit.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The other arcs are less obvious. For example, if a flight arrives in New York at time 13, it might sit on the ground until time 14.5, at which time it leaves for another city. This can be modeled with the ground arcs NY13–NY13.5, NY13.5–NY14, and NY14–NY14.5. In general, the flow on any ground arc represents the number of planes sitting on the ground in that city for that half-hour period. These ground arcs have no capacities and no costs. Finally, it is important to relate one day to the next. Suppose that one or more planes end up in New York at the end of the day, at time 20. They can either sit overnight in New York, or they can be flown to another city, where they will be available at time 8 the next morning. This behavior can be modeled with overnight arcs. The flow on an overnight arc such as NY20–NY8 represents the number of planes that sit overnight in New York. It has no capacity and a cost equal to the fixed cost of operating a plane. (By attaching the fixed costs of operating planes to the overnight arcs, rather than to the flight or ground arcs, there is no double-counting of fixed costs.) In contrast, the flow on an overnight arc such as NY20–Boston8 represents the number of planes flown overnight from New York to Boston. It has no capacity and a cost equal to the fixed cost of operating a plane plus the cost of flying a plane empty overnight. Note that the total flow on all overnight arcs equals the total number of planes being used—all planes being used must be somewhere overnight. In fact, this total must be less than or equal to the number of planes owned, four, because some of the planes might not be used at all.<br /> A few of the nodes and arcs for this network are shown in Figure 5.33. The flight arcs are the diagonal arcs, the ground arcs all point one step to the right, and the overnight arcs go backward from right to left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
With this network, flow balance (inflow equals outflow) exists at every node. This indicates conservation of planes. The same planes continue to circulate through the network day after day. Of course, to obtain different schedules on different days of the week, the model would have to be modified, and it would become considerably more complex. With the preceding discussion in mind, the variables and constraints for the model are shown in Figure 5.34. (See the file Flight Scheduling Big Picture.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The finished model is large, so it is shown in pieces. (See the file Flight Scheduling Finished.xlsx.) Figure 5.35 shows the potential flight schedule, plus the other inputs. Recall that TriCities wants to select the appropriate subset of these flights to fly, which could be all of them. (All monetary values are expressed in hundreds of dollars.) Note that the cost of flying a plane empty overnight is a constant. (A simple modification would allow this cost to depend on the origin and destination of the flight.)<br /> The information on the three types of arcs appears in Figures 5.36, 5.37, and 5.38. The flight arcs correspond exactly to the available flights in Figure 5.35. Note that each flight arc has a capacity of 1. There are many ground arcs (note the hidden rows in Figure 5.37), each extending one half-hour into the day, and their costs are all 0. Finally, there are only nine overnight arcs. Each has a fixed cost, and those that represent empty overnight flights also have an overnight cost. The rest is straightforward. As usual, you need to fill out a table of flow balance constraints, as shown in Figure 5.39. (Again, many rows have been hidden.) There is a constraint for each node—that is, each city/time combination. The typical formula for net outflow in cell I37, which can be copied down column I, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIF(Flight_origin,H37,Flight_flow)+SUMIF(Ground_origin,H37,Ground_flow)<br /> +SUMIF(Overnight_origin,H37,Overnight_flow)<br /> -(SUMIF(Flight_destination,H37,Flight_flow)<br /> +SUMIF(Ground_destination,H37,Ground_flow)<br /> +SUMIF(Overnight_destination,H37,Overnight_flow))</p>
 <p class="blog">
This looks complex, but it is simply the sum of outflows from the three types of arcs minus the sum of inflows from the three types of arcs. Because there must be flow balance at each node, each net outflow must be 0. (Also, keep in mind that all of the range names in this model can be created quickly with the Create from Selection shortcut, provided that you supply nice labels for headings.)<br /> Figures 5.40 and 5.41 show the rest of the model and the Solver dialog box. To find the number of planes used, sum the flows on all overnight arcs in cell B150 with the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUM(Overnight_flow)<br /> Then calculate the various monetary values with the usual SUMPRODUCT functions. For example, the formula for total net revenue from flights is<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Flight_net_revenue,Flight_flow)<br /> Finally, combine these into a profit objective in cell B156 with the formula<br /> B153-B154-B155<br /> The Solver dialog box follows easily—and is remarkably compact for such a large and complex model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution can be seen primarily from Figures 5.36 and 5.38. The former indicates that TriCities should fly only 17 of the potential 23 flights. The latter shows that no overnight flights should be flown, evidently because the cost of doing so is too large. It also shows that all four planes are used. Two of these sit overnight in Boston, and the other two sit overnight in Washington, D.C. The daily profit from this solution is $39,600.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> You could run many interesting sensitivity analyses. For example, what if TriCities had more planes? To answer this, you can run SolverTable with cell B4 as the single input cell, allowing it to vary from 4 to 8 in increments of 1, and keep track of the monetary values, as well as the number of flights flown. (This latter output is calculated in cell B158 with the formula =SUM(Flight_flow). See Figure 5.40.) The results appear in Figure 5.42. As expected, profit and the number of flights flown both increase when the company owns more planes, but this analysis does not take the cost of purchasing more planes into account. TriCities would need to trade off the cost of new planes with this increased profit.<br /> From Figure 5.42, you can see that TriCities still does not fly all 23 potential flights, even with eight planes. Could it? You can answer this question easily by changing the objective from maximizing profit to maximizing the number of flights flown (in cell B158) and rerunning Solver. If you do so, you will find that the maximum is 23. Therefore, TriCities could fly all 23 flights with eight planes, but the cost structure makes it more profitable to fly only 22. The driving factor here is evidently the fixed cost per plane. When TriCities owns eight planes, the optimal profit solution uses only seven of these planes. A final sensitivity analysis involves empty overnight flights. When TriCities owns seven planes, Figure 5.42 indicates (see cell E165) that it flies two empty overnight flights.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(These are both from Boston to Washington, D.C.) What happens to this solution if, as a matter of company policy, empty overnight flights are not allowed? You can modify the model in three ways to answer this question. First, you can impose a huge cost on overnight flights, effectively ruling them out. Second, you can impose capacities of zero on the overnight flight arcs (in Figure 5.38). Third, you can simply eliminate these arcs. By using the first method, you obtain the results shown in Figure 5.43. The solution changes fairly dramatically. Now TriCities uses only five of its seven planes, it flies only 19 (instead of 22) flights, and its profit decreases<br /> from $43,600 to $42,000.</p>
