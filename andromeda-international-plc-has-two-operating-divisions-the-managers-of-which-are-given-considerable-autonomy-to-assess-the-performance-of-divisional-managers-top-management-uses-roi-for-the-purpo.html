(b) The investment opportunity for Jupiter division will result in an ROI of 16.7% (that is, 15/90) which is above the cost of capital for the company. As a result, central management is likely to view the opportunity favourably. However, the effect of taking the opportunity will be to lower the existing ROI of the division. This may mean that the divisional manager will be reluctant to take on the opportunity. The investment opportunity for the Mars division provides an ROI of 10% (that is, 30/300), which is below the cost of capital of the business. As a result central management would not wish for this opportunity to be taken up. However, the opportunity will increase the ROI of the Mars division overall and, as a result, the divisional manager may be keen to invest in the opportunity. There may be reasons for investing in each opportunity which are not given in the question but which may be compelling. For example, it may be necessary to introduce the new product into the Jupiter division in order to ensure that the range of products offered to customers is complete. Failure to do so may result in a decline in overall sales. It may be that investment in the Mars division is important to ensure that productivity over the longer term does not slip behind that of its competitors.</p>

(c) Ideally, ROI should be calculated using the current value of the assets employed. By so doing we can see whether or not the returns are satisfactory as compared with the alternative use of those resources. Using cost (or cost less accumulated depreciation) as the basis for ROI will be measuring current performance against past outlays. Gross book value fails to take account of the age of the assets held. It may be that the assets are all near the end of their useful lives and are, therefore, highly depreciated. In such a case, the gross book value may produce a low ROI and may provide too high a ‘hurdle’ rate for new investment opportunities. Gross book value in such circumstances would also provide a poor approximation to the current value of the assets. Using net book value would overcome the problem mentioned above but, during a period of inflation, this measure may be significantly lower than the current value of the assets employed. In addition, there is the problem that ROI can improve over time simply because of the declining value of the assets employed. Divisional managers may be less inclined to replace old assets where this will lead to a decline in ROI.</p>
