            <p class="blog">CALCULATING NPV AT ACRON<br /> Acron is a large drug company. At the current time, the beginning of year 0, Acron is trying to decide whether one of its new drugs, Niagra, is worth pursuing. Niagra is in the final stages of development and will be ready to enter the market one year from now. The final cost of development, to be incurred at the beginning of year 1, is $9.3 million. Acron estimates that the demand for Niagra will gradually grow and then decline over its useful lifetime of 20 years. Specifically, the company expects its gross margin (revenue minus cost) to be $1.2 million in year 1, then to increase at an annual rate of 10% through year 8, and finally to decrease at an annual rate of 5% through year 20. Acron wants to develop a spreadsheet model of its 20-year cash flows, assuming its cash flows, other than the initial development cost, are incurred at the ends of the respective years.6 Using an annual discount rate of 12% for the purpose of calculating NPV, the drug company wants to answer the following questions:<br /> 1. Is the drug worth pursuing, or should Acron abandon it now and not incur the $9.3 million development cost?<br /> 2. How do changes in the model inputs change the answer to question 1?<br /> 3. How realistic is the model?<br /> <strong>Business Objectives</strong> To develop a model that calculates the NPV of Acron’s cash flows,<br /> to use this model to determine whether the drug should be developed further and then marketed,<br /> and to see how sensitive the answer to this question is to model parameters.<br /> <strong>Excel Objectives</strong> To illustrate efficient selection and copying of large ranges and to<br /> learn Excel’s NPV function.</p>

The key variables in Acron’s problem appear in Figure 2.38. (See the file Calculating NPV Big Picture.xlsx.) Although we won’t do so in this chapter, a thorough study of Acron’s problem would include uncertainty in the model and treat this uncertainty</p>
 <p class="blog">
explicitly, probably with simulation. For now, you can accept the values given in the statement of the problem and leave the simulation for a later chapter.<br /> The model of Acron’s cash flows appears in Figure 2.39. As with many financial spreadsheet models that extend over a multiyear period, you enter “typical” formulas in the first year or two and then copy this logic down to all years. (In a previous edition,we made the years go across, not down. In that case, splitting the screen is useful so that you can see the first and last years of data. Splitting the screen is explained in the following Excel Tip. The main reason we modified the model to have the years go down, not across, is that it now fits easily on a screen, without needing to split the screen.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Splitting the Screen<br /> To split the screen horizontally and vertically, select the cell where you want the split to occur and click Split on the View ribbon. This creates horizontal and vertical split lines that you can move if you like. Note: Starting in Excel 2013, there are no longer “split handles” next to the scrollbars, as there were in earlier versions of Excel. Microsoft evidently decided that these split handles were too difficult for users to find.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Developing the Spreadsheet Model<br /> To create the model, complete the following steps. (See the file Calculating NPV Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Inputs and range names. Enter the given input data in the blue cells, and name the ranges as shown. As usual, note that the range names for cells B4 through B9 can be created all at once with the Create from Selection shortcut, as can the range name for the gross margins in column B. Inthe latter case, select the range B12:B32 and then use the Create from Selection shortcut.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2)Cash flows. Start by entering the formula =5Gross_margin_year_1<br /> in cell B13 for the year 1 gross margin. Then enter the general formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=IF(A14&lt;=Peak_year,B13*(1+Rate_of_increase),<br /> B13*(1-Rate_of_decrease))<br /> in cell B14 and copy it down to cell B32 to calculate the other early gross margins. Note how this IF function checks the year index in column A to see whether sales are still increasing or have started to decrease. Of course, by using the (range-named) input cells in this formula, you can change any of these inputs in cells B6 through B8, and the calculated cells will automatically update. This is a much better practice than embedding the numbers in the formula itself.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Efficient Selection<br /> An easy way to select a large range, assuming that the first and last cells of the range are visible, is to select the first cell and then, with your finger on the Shift key, select the last cell. (Don’t forget that you can split the screen to make these first and last cells visible when the range is large.) This selects the entire range and is easier than scrolling<span class="tex-text">\(.^{7}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Efficient Copying with Ctrl+Enter<br /> An easy way to enter the same formula in a range all at once is to select the range (as in the preceding Excel Tip), type the formula, and press Ctrl+Enter (both keys at once). After you get used to this shortcut, you will probably use it all the time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Net present value. The NPV is based on the sequence of cash flows in column B. From the general discussion of NPV, to discount everything back to the beginning of year 1, the value in cell B13 should be multiplied by <span class="tex-text">\(1/y(1 + r)^{1}\)</span>, the value in cell B14 should be multiplied<br /> by <span class="tex-text">\(1/y(1 + r)^{2}\)</span>, and so on, and these quantities should be summed to obtain the NPV. (Here, r= 0.12 is the discount rate.) Fortunately, however, Excel has a built-in NPV function to accomplish this calculation. To use it, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=−Development_cost+NPV(Discount_rate,Gross_margin)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B34. The NPV function takes two arguments: the discount rate and a range of cash flows. Furthermore, it assumes that the first cell in this range is the cash flow at the end of year 1, the second cell is the cash flow at the end of year 2, and so on. This explains why the development cost is subtracted outside the NPV function—it is incurred at the beginning of year 1. In general, any cash flow incurred at the beginning of year 1 must be placed outside the NPV function so that it won’t be discounted.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To get some understanding of NPV, note that the sum of the cash flows in column B is slightly more than $34.14 million, but the NPV (aside from the development cost) is only about $12.60 million. This is because values further into the future are discounted so heavily. At the extreme, the $1.2636 million cash flow in year 20 is equivalent to only $1.2636<span class="tex-text">\([1/(1 + 0.12)^{20}\)</span>] 5 $0.131 million now.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: NPV<br /> The NPV function takes two arguments, the discount rate (entered as a decimal, such as 0.12 for 12%) and a stream of cash flows. These cash flows are assumed to occur in consecutive years, starting at the end of year 1. If there is an initial cash flow at the beginning of year 1, such as an initial investment, it should be entered outside the NPV function. Also, note that blank cells in a cash flow range are not treated as zeros by the NPV function. You can see how this works in the file NPV with Missing Values.xlsx in the Extra Examples folder for this chapter. (There is also an XNPV function that has three arguments: a discount rate, a series of cash flows, and a series of dates when the cash flows occur. Because these dates do not have to be equally spaced through time, this function is considerably more flexible than the NPV function. We will not use the XNPV function in this book, but you can learn more about it in Excel’s online help.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Deciding Whether to Continue with the Drug<br /> NPV calculations are typically used to see whether a certain project should be undertaken. If the NPV is positive, the project is worth pursuing. If the NPV is negative, the company should look for other places to invest its money. Figure 2.39 shows that the NPV for this drug is positive, over $3 million<span class="tex-text">\(.^{8}\)</span> Therefore, if Acron is comfortable with its predictions of future cash flows, it should continue with the development and marketing of the drug. However, Acron might first want to see how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the sales predictions. After all, these predictions are intelligent guesses at best.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One possible sensitivity analysis appears in Figure 2.40. Here you can build a oneway data table to see how the NPV changes when the number of years of increase (the input in cell B6) changes. Again, the important question is whether the NPV stays positive. It certainly does when the input variable is greater than its current value of 8. However, if sales start decreasing soon enough—that is, if the value in B6 is 3 or less—the NPV turns negative. This should probably not concern Acron, because its best guess for the years of increase is considerably greater than 3.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another possibility is to see how long and how good the good years are. To do this, you can create the two-way data table shown in Figure 2.41, where cell B7 is the row input cell and cell B6 is the column input cell. Now you can see that if sales increase through year 6, all reasonable yearly increases result in a positive NPV. However, if sales increase only through year 5, then a low enough yearly increase can produce a negative NPV. Acron might want to step back and estimate how likely these bad scenarios are before proceeding with the drug.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Limitations of the Model<br /> Probably the major flaw in this model is that it ignores uncertainty, and future cash flows are highly uncertain, mainly due to uncertain demand for the drug. Incorporating uncertainty into</p>
 <p class="blog">
this type of model will be covered when we discuss simulation in Chapters 10 and 11. Aside from this uncertainty, there are almost always ways to make any model more realistic—at the cost of increased complexity. For example, you could model the impact of competition on Niagra’s profitability. Alternatively, you could allow Acron to treat its prices as decision variables. However, this might influence the likelihood of competition entering the market, which would certainly complicate the model. The point is that this model is only a start. When millions of dollars are at stake, a more thorough analysis is certainly warranted.</p>

 <p class="blog">
8:You might wonder why we didn’t discount back to the beginning of the current year, year 0, instead of year 1. This is a fairly arbitrary decision on our part. To discount back to year 0, you would simply divide the current NPV by 1.12. The important point, however, is that this would have no bearing on Acron’s decision: A positive NPV would stay positive, and a negative NPV would stay negative.</p>
