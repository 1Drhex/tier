Kauffman’s [5] solution is provided in Figure 11.6, which represents a system of heat exchangers that will transfer heat from the hot streams to the cold ones in the amounts desired. It is important to note that this is but one of many possible schemes. The optimum system would require a trial-and-error procedure that would examine a host of different schemes. Obviously, the economics would also come into play.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As noted in the , in many chemical and petrochemical plants there are cold streams that must be heated and hot streams that must be cooled. The problem of optimum heat exchanger networks to accomplish this has been extensively studied and is available in the literature. This example provides one simple illustration.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Highly interconnected networks of exchangers can save a great deal of quality energy in a chemical plant, and as noted above, an economic analysis should be included. Theodore [7] extended the above example to include two other considerations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Outline how to solve the above problem if the heat exchanger cost is a function of the heat exchanger area. The network should be such that the total cost of the resulting network is minimized. In effect, the economics involved are to be included with the outline to the solution.<br /> 2. Outline how to solve the two previous problems so that the network’s entropy is decreased and the network’s costs are minimized. Is there a unique solution? Justify your answer to this question. If there is not a unique solution, outline how a practicing chemical engineer could arrive at a reasonable solution to this heat exchanger network problem. As noted above, the more interconnected they are, however, the harder the plant is to control, start-up, and shut down.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Often auxiliary heat sources and cooling sources must be included in the plant design in order to ensure that the plant can operate smoothly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, there are many possible combinations of interconnected heat exchangers that will work. Detailed cost analyses would be needed to determine which one is best. For each exchanger in the network, one needs to make sure that the duties on each side are equal and that there are no temperature crossovers. These occur when the stream being cooled is colder than the lowest temperature of the stream being heated at some point in the exchanger. This is (of course) forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics [2, 3].</p>
