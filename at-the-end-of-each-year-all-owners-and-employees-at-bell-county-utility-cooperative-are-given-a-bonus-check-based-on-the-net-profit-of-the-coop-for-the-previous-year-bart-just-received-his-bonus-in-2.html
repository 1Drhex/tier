            <p class="blog">At the end of each year, all owners and employees at Bell County Utility Cooperative are given a bonus check based on the net profit of the Coop for the previous year. Bart just received his bonus in the amount of $8530. He plans to invest it in an annuity program that returns 7% per year. Bart’s long-term plans are to quit the Coop job some years in the future when he is still young enough to start his own business. Part of his future living expenses will be paid from the proceeds that this year’s bonus accumulates over his remaining years at the Coop.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Use a spreadsheet to determine the amount of annual year-end withdrawal that he can anticipate (starting 1 year after he quits) that will continue forever. He is thinking of working 15 or 20 more years.<br /> (b) Determine the amount Bart must accumulate after 15 and 20 years to generate $3000 per year forever</p>

<strong>Solution by Spreadsheet</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) Figure 6–5 presents the cash flow diagram for <em>n</em> = 15 years of accumulation at 7% per year on the $8530 deposited now. The accumulated amount after n = 15 years is indicated as <span class="tex-text">\( F_{after 15} \)</span>= ? and the withdrawal series starts at the end of year 16. The diagram for n = 20 would appear the same, except there is a 20-year accumulation period.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet in Figure 6–6 shows the functions and answers for n = 15 years in columns C and D. The FV function displays the total accumulated at 7% after 15 years as $23,535. The perpetual withdrawal is determined by viewing this accumulated amount as a P value and by applying the formula</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">A = P(i) = 23,535(0.07) = $1647 per year</p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet function = D9*B7 performs this same computation in cell reference format in column D.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Answers for n = 20 years are displayed in column E. At a consistent 7% per year return, Bart’s perpetual income is estimated as $1647 after 15 years, or $2311 per year if he waits for 20 years.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) To obtain a perpetual annual withdrawal of $3000, it is necessary to determine how much must be accumulated 1 year before the first withdrawal of $3000. This is an application of the relation A = P(i) solved for <em>P</em>, or</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P =\frac{ A}{i} = \frac{ 3000}{0.07 } = \$42,857\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This P value is independent of how long Bart works at the Coop because he must accumulate this amount to achieve his goal. Figure 6–6, row 13, shows the function and result. Note that the number of years n does not enter into the function = 3000∕B13.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comment</strong><br /> The NPER function can be used to determine how many years it will take for the current amount of $8530 to accumulate the required $42,857 at 7% per year. The row 15 function indicates that Bart will have to work at the Coop for just under 24 additional years.</p>
