1. The water in the piston–cylinder assembly is a closed system.</p>

2. There is no heat transfer with the surroundings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. The system is at an equilibrium state initially and finally. There is no change in kinetic or potential energy between these two states.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Analysis </strong>As the volume of the system increases during the process, there is an energy transfer by work from the system during the expansion, as well as an energy transfer by work to the system via the paddle wheel. The net work can be evaluated from an energy balance, which reduces with assumptions 2 and 3 to</p>

The minus sign indicates that the work input by stirring is greater in magnitude than the work done by the water as it expands.</p>

The amount of entropy produced is evaluated by applying the entropy balance Eq. 6.24. Since there is no heat transfer, the term accounting for entropy transfer vanishes:</p>

1 Although each end state is an equilibrium state at the same pressure and temperature, the pressure and temperature are not necessarily uniform throughout the system at intervening states, nor are they necessarily constant in value during the process. Accordingly, there is no well-defined “path” for the process. This is emphasized by the use of dashed lines to represent the process on these p–v and T–s diagrams. The dashed lines indicate only that a process has taken place, and no “area” should be associated with them. In particular, note that the process is adiabatic, so the “area” below the dashed line on the T–s diagram can have no significance as heat transfer. Similarly, the work cannot be associated with an area on the p–v diagram.</p>

2 The change of state is the same in the present example as in . However, in Example 6.1 the change of state is brought about by heat transfer while the system undergoes an internally reversible process. Accordingly, the value of entropy production for the process of  is zero. Here, fluid friction is present during the process and the entropy production is positive in value. Accordingly, different values of entropy production are obtained for two processes between the same end states. This demonstrates that entropy production is not a property.</p>
