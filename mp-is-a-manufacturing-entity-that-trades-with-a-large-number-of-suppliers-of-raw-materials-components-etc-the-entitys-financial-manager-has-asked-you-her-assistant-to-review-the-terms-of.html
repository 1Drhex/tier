            <p class="blog">MP is a manufacturing entity that trades with a large number of suppliers of raw materials, components, etc. The entity’s financial manager has asked you, her assistant, to review the terms of trade and their associated costs. As part of the exercise, you randomly choose three regular suppliers of one particular component. They have the following terms:<br /> Supplier A Charges a fixed penalty of 2 per cent of invoice value for late payment.<br /> Supplier B Charges compound interest at 2 per cent per 30-day period after the due date of payment.<br /> Supplier C Offers a 2 per cent discount if payment is made within ten days of invoice date but charges simple interest at 10 per cent per annum on the invoice value if payment is after the due date.<br /> Assume that the due date for payment in each case is 30 days but that MP’s current credit control policy is to take an average of 90 days to pay these suppliers’ invoices.<br /> To simplify your calculations, assume also that MP purchases $1,000 worth of goods from each supplier every month.<br /> Requirements<br /> Write a report to the financial manager that includes:<br /> (i) a calculation of the annualised interest rate (i.e. per cent per annum) for each of the three suppliers.<br /> (ii) a discussion of the arguments for and against using trade credit as a source of funds, in general and from MP’s point of view, given their current credit policy.</p> <p class="blog">(iii) a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages to MP of introducing standard terms of trade with which all suppliers will have to conform.</p>

Report<br /> To: Financial manager<br /> From: Assistant financial manager<br /> Subject: Credit taken from suppliers<br /> Date:<br /> (i) You asked me to compare the terms of trade imposed by three suppliers. Say, for illustration, that purchases amount to $1,000 per 30 days, that is, $12,200 p.a.<br /> ● Supplier A. If payment is late every period, this would cost $20 for every $1,000 owed. If the entity delays payment for 60 days beyond the due date, this is 365 ÷ 60 × $20 = $122, or 12.2 per cent.<br /> ● Supplier B. The formula is<span class="tex-text">\( (1 +r)^{p}\)</span>-1, where p is the number of 30-day delayed payment periods. There are 12.2 30-day periods in 365 days, therefore <span class="tex-text">\((1 + 0.02)^{12.2}-1\)</span> = 27.3 per cent on an annualised basis.<br /> An alternative approach would use an interest charge of 2 per cent compounded for two 30-day periods = 24.6 per cent.<br /> ● Supplier C. If the discount is not taken, the cost of the lost discount is 365 ÷ 20 =18.25 times, approximately 36 per cent or 42 per cent if compounded.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If MP ignores the discount and also pay late, then the annualised cost is 10 per cent as given in the question, plus the opportunity cost of the lost discount.<br /> (ii) Trade credit is often talked of as being ‘free’ credit. Of course, it is not free, as the financing costs of the supplier are built into the cost of goods and services. Factors to consider are:<br /> ● Suppliers’ goodwill – essential if the entity operates ‘just-in-time’ systems.<br /> ● Entity image – does the firm want a reputation as a poor payer or, worse, as having financial difficulties that might have the result of suppliers increasing their prices to cover perceived risk of default?<br /> ● Effect on credit rating by agencies, which might raise the cost of all borrowing.<br /> ● Buying power of the entity and its relative position in the industry.<br /> ● Industry norms.<br /> ● The cost of lost discounts, which can be substantial.<br /> ● Suppliers’ bargaining position. Very few entities are sole suppliers of anything, but the fewer suppliers there are, the more strength they have to refuse to supply slow payers.<br /> (iii) An advantage of having a common policy is that the entity can have one payment policy covering all suppliers, which might reduce administrative costs and reduce errors. Disadvantages are that some suppliers may refuse to supply on MP ‘s terms, which reduces the number of competitive quotes that the entity may need to obtain. If the terms are more onerous than the supplier is accustomed to, it might also result in increased costs although, clearly, the costs of credit would have to be seen alongside the increased cost of goods and services.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Summary<br /> MP already appears to have a partially common policy, in that we insist on 30 days’ credit. The entity should consider whether this is in their best interests, given the evidence of lost discounts. Bank overdraft finance may be cheaper than forgoing discounts. The entity could also approach suppliers who do not give discounts at present, to enquire if they will allow better terms for earlier payment.<br /> I hope that you find the above sufficient for your needs. If I can be of further help, please let me know.</p>
