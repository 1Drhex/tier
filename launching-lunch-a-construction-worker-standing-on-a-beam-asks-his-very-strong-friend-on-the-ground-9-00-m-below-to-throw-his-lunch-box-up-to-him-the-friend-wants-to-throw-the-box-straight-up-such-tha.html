(a) To solve the problem we will assume that the lunch box is going straight up and the effect of air resistance on its motion can be neglected. Let us choose a positive x-axis upward (in the direction of the initial box toss) and the origin as the point from which the box was tossed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) In this problem, we are given the initial and final positions of the lunch box (and thus we can calculate its displacement), its acceleration, and its final velocity. We need to find the initial speed of the ball (we know it is tossed upward, but we do not know its speed). We can record all the givens for the problem as follows, where the subscript f stands for the final values when the box is being caught (notice, the final velocity is positive, while the acceleration is negative):</p>

 <span class="tex-text">\(g_{x}=-9.81 m / s ^{2}, \text { and } v_{x 0}=?\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since this part of the problem does not involve time, we can use Equation 3-22. Note that the acceleration and the initial velocity have opposite directions:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x, f }^{2}-v_{x_{0}}^{2}=2 a_{x} \Delta x\)</span> <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) To determine how long the box will be in the air before it is caught <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{1}\right)\)</span>, we can use Equation 3-10, <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}(t)=v_{x_{0}}+g_{x} \Delta t_{1}\)</span>, as we know the initial and final velocities of the box and its acceleration:</p>

 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) To determine how long it will takes for the box to rise halfway up, or 4.5 m <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)\)</span>, we can use Equation 3-17,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(x(t)=x_{0}+v_{x_{0}} t+\frac{1}{2} a_{x} t^{2} \text { when } t_{0}=0\)</span> {3-17}</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(x_{\text {height } / 2}=x_{0}+v_{x_{0}} \Delta t_{2}+\frac{1}{2} a_{x} \Delta t_{2}^{2}\)</span> . For clarity, we will omit the units while solving this quadratic equation:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(4.50=0+13.3 \Delta t_{2}+\frac{1}{2}(-9.81) \Delta t_{2}^{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(4.905 \Delta t_{2}^{2}-13.3 \Delta t_{2}+4.50=0\)</span> (0)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{1}=0.396 s\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{2}=2.32 s\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This quadratic equation has two roots. This makes sense, as the box passes the 4.50 m point on the way up at the first time, <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{1}\)</span>, and then would normally pass the same point on the way back down at the second time, <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{2}\)</span>, if it were not caught before returning back down. So for this example, we are only interested in the first solution, <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{1}=0.396 s\)</span>, as the box is caught on the way up. Notice that the time it takes the box to go halfway up is less than half the time of the box’s total trip up: <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{2}\right)_{1}&lt;\frac{\Delta t_{1}}{2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This happens because the box moves faster during the</p>
 <p class="blog">
first half of its trajectory on the way up than during the second half due to its slowing down. We will discuss how to visualize this result in part (e) of the solution. (e) To find how high above the ground the box will be after half of the total time has elapsed <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta t_{1} / 2=0.652 s \right)\)</span> , we use Equation 3-17 once again:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(x_{1 / 2 \text { time }}=x_{0}+v_{x_{0}} \frac{\Delta t_{1}}{2}+\frac{1}{2} a_{x}\left(\frac{\Delta t_{1}}{2}\right)^{2}\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(=0+\left(13.3 \frac{ m }{ s }\right)(0.652 s )+\frac{1}{2}\left(-9.81 \frac{ m }{ s ^{2}}\right)(0.652 s )^{2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(=6.59 m &gt;\frac{1}{2}(9.00 m )=4.500 m\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This result also makes sense because during the first half of the time of the journey, the box moves faster than during the second half of the time. Therefore, it will cover more than half of the total height during the first half of the time of its upward motion.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(f ) We can use the principle of graphical integration discussed in the previous section to visualize the results found in the previous parts by plotting the <span class="tex-text">\(x(t), v_{x}(t), \text { and } a_{x}(t)\)</span> graphs for the motion of the lunch box (Figure 3-31).</p>

<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The principle of graphical integration discussed earlier and applied to interpret part (f ) is very useful in making sense of kinematics problems. We recommend that you use the Desmos graphing calculator (www.desmos.com/calculator) or another way of plotting data to model the results of kinematics problems and make sense of them. See Interactive Activity 3-3 for guidance on how to do this.</p>
