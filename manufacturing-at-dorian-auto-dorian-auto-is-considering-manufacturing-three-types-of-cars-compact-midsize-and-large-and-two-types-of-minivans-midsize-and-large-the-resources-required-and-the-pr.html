            <p class="blog">Manufacturing at Dorian Auto</p> <p class="blog">Dorian Auto is considering manufacturing three types of cars (compact, midsize, and large) and two types of minivans (midsize and large). The resources required and the profit contributions yielded by each type of vehicle are shown in Table 6.3. At present, 6500 tons of steel and 65,000 hours of labor are available. If any vehicles of a given type are produced, production of that type of vehicle is economically feasible only if at least a minimal number of that type are produced. These minimal numbers are also listed in Table 6.3. Dorian wants to find a production schedule that maximizes its<br /> profit.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use a linear model with binary variables to determine which types of vehicles to produce (above their minimal requirements), and in what quantities, to maximize profit.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> This is basically a product mix problem, similar to those in Chapter 3. Therefore, the same comments about inputs discussed there apply here as well. The only new inputs in this problem are the minimal production quantities. These might be policy decisions determined by Dorian—management sees no reason to produce midsize minivans unless it can produce at least 200 of them, say—but these policy decisions are undoubtedly based on costs. Presumably, the fixed costs of product design, manufacturing, and marketing are prohibitive unless minimal numbers are produced.</p> <p class="blog">Table 6.3 Data for the Dorian Car Example:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 675px; height: 246px;" border="0" width="432" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Large Minivan</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Midsize Minivan</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Large Car</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Midsize Car</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Compact Car</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Vehicle Type</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">8</td> <td dir="LTR">6</td> <td dir="LTR">5</td> <td dir="LTR">2</td> <td dir="LTR">1.5</td> <td dir="LTR">Steel (tons)/unit</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">55</td> <td dir="LTR">45</td> <td dir="LTR">40</td> <td dir="LTR">25</td> <td dir="LTR">30</td> <td dir="LTR">Labor hours/unit</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">200</td> <td dir="LTR">200</td> <td dir="LTR">1000</td> <td dir="LTR">1000</td> <td dir="LTR">1000</td> <td dir="LTR">Minimum production (if any)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$7,000</td> <td dir="LTR">$5,500</td> <td dir="LTR">$3,000</td> <td dir="LTR">$2,500</td> <td dir="LTR">$2,000</td> <td dir="LTR">Profit contribution/unit</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

The variables and constraints for the Dorian model are shown in Figure 6.18. (See the file Either-Or Manufacturing Big Picture.xlsx.) Dorian must decide not only how many of each type of vehicle to produce, but also which types to produce. Of course, after it decides to produce midsize minivans, say, then it must produce at least 200 of them. The constraints include the usual resource availability constraints. In addition, there are lower and upper limits on the production quantities of any vehicle type. The lower limit is zero or the minimal production quantity, depending on whether that vehicle type is produced. The upper limit is similar to the upper limit in the Great Thread’s fixed-cost model in Example 6.2. That is, it is either zero, if the vehicle type is not produced at all, or it is some suitable large number. As in , this large number can be the number of that type of vehicle that could be produced if all of the steel and labor hours were devoted to it alone.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The example can be modeled with the following steps. (See Figure 6.19 and the file Either-Or Manufacturing Finished.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Inputs. Enter the input data in the light blue ranges.<br /> 2) Number of vehicles produced. Enter any trial values for the number of vehicles of each type produced in the Units_produced range.<br /> 3) Binary variables for minimum production. Enter any trial 0–1 values in the Produce_at_least_minimum range. If a value in this range is 1, this means that Dorian must produce at least the minimum number of the corresponding vehicle type. A value of 0 in this range means that Dorian does not produce any of the corresponding vehicle type.<br /> 4) Lower limits on production. The either–or constraints are implemented with the binary variables in row 13 and the inequalities indicated in rows 15 through 19. To obtain the lower limits on production, enter the formula<br /> =B7*B13<br /> in cell B15 and copy it across row 15. This lower limit implies that if the binary variable in row 13 is 1, then Dorian must produce at least the minimum number of that vehicle type. However, if the binary variable is 0, then the lower bound in row 15 is 0 and is essentially redundant—it just says that production must be nonnegative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Upper limits on production. To obtain upper limits on production, enter the formula<br /> =MIN($D$23/B5,$D$24/B6)*B13<br /> in cell B19 and copy it across row 19. Note that the MIN term in this formula is the maximum number of compact cars Dorian could make if it devoted all of its resources to compact cars. (A similar upper limit was used in the Great Threads model in .) If the binary variable in row 13 is 1, this upper limit is essentially redundant—production can never be greater than this in any case. But if the binary variable is 0, this upper limit is 0, which prevents Dorian from making any vehicles of this type. To summarize the lower and upper limits, if the binary variable is 1, the production limits become<br /> Minimum production required ≤Production ≤ Maximum production possible<br /> On the other hand, if the binary variable is 0, the limits become<br /> 0 ≤# Production ≤ 0<br /> Of course, these latter inequalities imply that production is 0. Exactly one of these cases must hold for each car type, so they successfully implement the either–or constraints. These lower and upper limits are the keys to the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Steel and labor used. Calculate the tons of steel and number of labor hours used in the Resources_used range by entering the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B5:F5,Units_produced)<br /> in cell B23 and copying it to cell B24.<br /> 7) Profit. Calculate the profit in cell B27 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B9:F9,Units_produced)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The completed Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 6.20. The objective is to maximize profit, the decision variable cells are the production quantities and the binary variables, and the constraints specify the production limits and resource availabilities. Note that the production quantities are not constrained to be integers, although you could do so. Extra integer constraints only make the model more difficult to optimize, and if the optimal number of some vehicle type turns out to be 472.7, say, it is probably acceptable to round this up to 473 or down to 472.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution in Figure 6.19 indicates, by the 0 values in row 13, that Dorian should not produce any midsize or large cars. The number of 1’s in this row, however, indicates that Dorian must produce at least the minimum number (1000) of compact cars and the minimum number (200) of each type of minivan. More specifically, the company should produce just enough compact cars and midsize minivans to meet the minimal production quantities. These vehicle types are relatively profitable, given the resources they use. However, they are evidently not as profitable as large minivans. The company should make as many of these as it can, after producing the compact cars and midsize minivans, until it runs out of labor hours.<br /> This solution is certainly not intuitive. (For example, if large minivans are so profitable, why doesn’t the company produce all large minivans and nothing else? Do you see why?) Also, this solution appears to be very sensitive to the inputs. Although we do not present any formal sensitivity analysis with SolverTable, we urge you to try different values for the minimal production quantities, the unit profit contributions, and/or the resource availabilities. We found that even small changes in these can yield a very different optimal production policy. For example, you can check that if the availability of steel decreases to 6000 tons, only compact cars and midsize minivans are produced, both above their minimal levels, and no large minivans are produced.</p>
