(i) Brand names<br /> Purchase of Brand X brand name<br /> A brand name is an intangible non-current asset. Intangible non-current assets are covered by IAS 38 – Intangible assets.<br /> IAS 38 allows purchased intangible non-current assets to be recognised in the financial tatements, if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow from the assets and if their value can be measured reliably at the date of purchase. As a value has been given for the brand X, it is reasonable to assume that its value can be measured reliably. The brand name ‘Brand X’ should be recognised in the balance sheet at $220,000 at<br /> 31 October 2002 and amortised over its useful economic life of 10 years. $22,000 per year will be charged to the income statement.<br /> The entity must carry out an impairment review at the end of the first financial year after the acquisition, and consider whether the performance of the entity, after the acquisition of the brand, has improved in line with expectations.<br /> Internally generated brand names. Brand Z is an internally generated brand name. Some types of internally generated intangible non-current assets can be recognised in the balance sheet if they meet specific criteria, however IAS 38 specifically states that internally generated brand names should not be recognised as assets under any circumstances. All expenditure will be charged to the income statement in the year it was incurred.<br /> (ii) Goodwill<br /> Purchased goodwill from Q. Purchased goodwill is the price paid over and above the fair value of the assets acquired.</p>

Positive purchased goodwill of $30,000 will be recognised in the balance sheet at cost at 31 October 2002. Annual impairment reviews will be carried out as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations but no amortisation will be provided.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Increase in value of purchased goodwill. IFRS 3 does not allow goodwill to be revalued upwards, so no action should be taken on the directors’ valuation. Purchased goodwill will gradually be replaced by self-generated goodwill, so the increase in the valuation is due to internally generated goodwill arising since the acquisition. IFRS 3 specifically forbids the capitalisation of internally generated goodwill.</p>
