            <p class="blog">Economic Service Life of a Lift Truck</p> <p class="blog">Suppose a company has a forklift, but is considering purchasing a new electric-lift truck that would cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$18,000\)</span>, have operating costs of <span class="tex-text">\(\$1,000\)</span> in the first year, and have a salvage value of <span class="tex-text">\(\$10,000\)</span> at the end of the first year. For the remaining years, operating costs increase each year by <span class="tex-text">\(15\%\)</span> over the previous year’s operating costs. Similarly, the salvage value declines each year by <span class="tex-text">\(25\%\)</span> from the previous year’s salvage value. The lift truck has a maximum life of seven years. An overhaul costing <span class="tex-text">\(\$3,000\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\$4,500\)</span> will be required during the fifth and seventh years of service, respectively. The firm’s required rate of return is <span class="tex-text">\(15\%\)</span>. Find the economic service life of this new machine.</p> <p class="blog">DISCUSSION: For an asset whose revenues are either unknown or irrelevant, we compute its economic life on the basis of the costs for the asset and its year-by-year salvage values. To determine an asset’s economic service life, we need to compare the options of keeping the asset for one year, two years, three years, and so forth. The option that results in the lowest annual equivalent cost (AEC) gives the economic service life of the asset.</p>

• <span class="tex-text">\(N = 1\)</span>: One-year replacement cycle. In this case, the machine is bought, used for one year, and sold at the end of year 1. The cash flow diagram for this option is shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 14.4\)</span>. The annual equivalent cost for this option is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(AEC(15\%) = \$18,000(A/P, 15\%, 1) + \$1,000 &#8211; \$10,000\)</span> <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
Note that <span class="tex-text">\((A/P, 15\%, 1) = (F/P, 15\%, 1)\)</span> and the annual equivalent cost is the equivalent cost at the end of year 1, since <span class="tex-text">\(N = 1\)</span>. Because we are calculating the annual equivalent cost in the computation of <span class="tex-text">\(AEC(15\%)\)</span>, we have treated cost items with a positive sign, while the salvage value has a negative sign.</p>

• <span class="tex-text">\(N = 2\)</span>: Two-year replacement cycle. In this case, the truck will be used for two years and disposed of at the end of year 2. The operating cost in year 2 is <span class="tex-text">\(15\%\)</span> higher than that in year 1, and the salvage value at the end of year 2 is <span class="tex-text">\(25\%\)</span> lower than that at the end of year 1. The cash flow diagram for this option is also shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 14.4\)</span>. The annual equivalent cost over the two-year period is</p>

•<span class="tex-text">\(N = 3\)</span>:Three-year replacement cycle. In this case, the truck will be used for three years and sold at the end of year 3.

The operating cost per year increases at a rate of <span class="tex-text">\(15\%\)</span>. The cash flow diagram for this option is also shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 14.4\)</span>. The annual equivalent cost over the three-year period is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(AEC(15\%) = [\$18,000 + \$1,000(P/A_{1} 15\%, 15\%, 3)](A/P, 15\%, 3)\)</span> <p class="blog">

• Similarly, we can find the annual equivalent costs for the options of keeping the asset for four, five, six, and seven years. One has to note that there is an additional cost of overhaul in year 5. The cash flow diagram when <span class="tex-text">\(N=7\)</span> is shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 14.4\)</span>. The computed annual equivalent costs for each of these options are</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(N = 4, AEC(15\%) = \$6,678\)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(N = 5, AEC(15\%) = \$6,642\)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(N = 6, AEC(15\%) = \$6,258\)</span>,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(N = 7, AEC(15\%) = \$6,394\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the preceding calculated <span class="tex-text">\(AEC\)</span> values for <span class="tex-text">\(N = 1, . . . , 7\)</span>, we find that <span class="tex-text">\(AEC(15\%)\)</span> is smallest when <span class="tex-text">\(N = 6\)</span>.If the truck were to be sold after six years, it would have an annual cost of <span class="tex-text">\(\$6,258\)</span> per year. If it were to be used for a period other than six years, the annual equivalent costs would be higher than <span class="tex-text">\(\$6,258\)</span>. Thus, a life span of six years for this truck results in the lowest annual cost. We conclude that the economic service life of the truck is six years. By replacing the assets perpetually according to an economic life of six years, we obtain the minimum annual equivalent cost stream. <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 14.5\)</span> illustrates this concept. Of course, we should envision a long period of required service for this kind of asset.</p>
