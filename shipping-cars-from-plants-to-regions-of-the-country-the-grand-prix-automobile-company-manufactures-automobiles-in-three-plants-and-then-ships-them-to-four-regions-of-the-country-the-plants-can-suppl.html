In some cases it might be possible to increase the “base” capacities, by using overtime, for example. In such cases the model could be modified to determine the amounts of additional capacity to use (and pay for).<br /> ■ The customer demands are typically estimated from some type of forecasting model (as discussed in Chapter 13). The forecasts are often based on historical customer demand data.<br /> ■ The unit shipping costs come from a transportation cost analysis—what does it really cost to send a single automobile from any plant to any region? This is not an easy question to answer, and it requires an analysis of the best mode of transportation (such as railroad, ship, or truck). However, companies typically have the required data. Actually, the unit “shipping” cost can also include the unit production cost at each plant. However, if this cost is the same across all plants, as we are tacitly assuming here, it can be omitted from the model.</p>

The variables and constraints required for this model are shown in Figure 5.1. (See the file Transportation Big Picture.xlsx.) The company must decide exactly the number of autos to send from each plant to each region—a shipping plan. Then it can calculate the total number of autos sent out of each plant and the total number received by each region.</p>

<strong>Representing Transportation in a Network Model</strong><br /> A more detailed network diagram of this model appears in Figure 5.2. This diagram is typical of network models. It consists of nodes and arcs. A node, indicated by an oval, generally represents a geographical location. In this case the nodes on the left correspond to plants, and the nodes on the right correspond to regions. An arc, indicated by an arrow, generally represents a route for transporting a product from one node to another. Here, the arcs all go from a plant node to a region node—from left to right.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The problem data fit nicely on such a diagram. The capacities are placed next to the plant nodes, the demands are placed next to the region nodes, and the unit shipping costs are placed on the arcs. The decision variables are usually called flows. They represent the amounts shipped on the various arcs. Sometimes (although not in this problem), there are upper limits on the flows on some or all of the arcs. These upper limits, called arc capacities, can also be shown on the diagram<span class="tex-text">\(.^{1}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model appears in Figure 5.3. (See the file Transportation Finished.xlsx.) To develop this model, perform the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Inputs<span class="tex-text">\(.^{2}\)</span> Enter the unit shipping costs, plant capacities, and region demands in the light blue cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Shipping plan. Enter any trial values for the shipments from plants to regions in the Shipping_plan range. These are the decision variable cells. Note that this rectangular range is exactly the same shape as the range where the unit shipping costs are entered. This is a natural model design, and it simplifies the formula in step 5.<br /> 3) Numbers shipped from plants. To calculate the amount shipped out of each plant in the range G13:G15, select this range and click the summation (∑) button.<br /> 4) Amounts received by regions. Similarly, calculate the amount shipped to each region in the range C16:F16 by selecting the range and clicking the summation button.<br /> 5) Total shipping cost. Calculate the total cost of shipping power from the plants to the regions in the Total_cost cell with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(C6:F8,Shipping_plan)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula sums all products of unit shipping costs and amounts shipped. You now see the benefit of placing unit shipping costs and amounts shipped in similar-size rectangular ranges—it allows you to use the SUMPRODUCT function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> Invoke Solver with the settings shown in Figure 5.4. As usual, check the Non-Negative option and specify the Simplex LP method before optimizing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The Solver solution appears in Figure 5.3 and is illustrated graphically in Figure 5.5. The company incurs a total shipping cost of $176,050 by using the shipments listed in Figure 5.5. Except for the six routes shown, no other routes are used. Most of the shipments occur on the low-cost routes, but this is not always the case. For example, the route from plant 2 to region 1 is relatively expensive, but it is used. On the other hand, the route from plant 3 to region 2 is relatively cheap, but it is not used. A good shipping plan tries to use cheap routes, but it is constrained by capacities and demands.<br /> Note that the available capacity is not all used. The reason is that total capacity is 1550, whereas total demand is only 1250. Even though the demand constraints are of the “≥” type, there is clearly no reason to send the regions more than they request because it only increases shipping costs. Therefore, the optimal plan sends them the minimal amounts they request and no more. In fact, the demand constraints could have been modeled as “=” constraints, and Solver would have reached exactly the same solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> There are many sensitivity analyses you could perform on this basic transportation model. For example, you could vary any one of the unit shipping costs, capacities, or demands. The effect of any such change in a single input is captured nicely in Solver’s sensitivity report, shown in Figure 5.6. The top part indicates the effects of changes in the unit shipping costs. The results here are typical. For all routes with positive flows, the corresponding reduced cost is zero, whereas for all routes not currently being used, the reduced cost indicates how much less the unit shipping cost would have to be before the company would start shipping along that route. For example, if the unit shipping cost from plant 2 to region 3 decreased by more than $69, this route would become attractive.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The bottom part of this report is useful because of its shadow prices. For example, plants 1 and 3 are currently shipping all of their capacity, so the company would benefit from having more capacity at these plants. In particular, the report indicates that each extra unit of capacity at plant 1 is worth $119, and each extra unit of capacity at plant 3 is worth $72. However, because the allowable increase for each of these is 100, you know that after an increase in capacity of 100 at either plant, further increases will probably be worth less than the current shadow prices.<br /> One interesting analysis that cannot be performed with Solver’s sensitivity report is to keep shipping costs and capacities constant and allow all of the demands to change by a certain percentage (positive or negative). To perform this analysis, you can use SolverTable, with the varying percentage as the single input. Then you keep track of the total cost and any particular amounts shipped of interest. The key to doing this correctly is to modify the model slightly, as illustrated in the previous chapter, before running SolverTable. The appropriate modifications appear in the third worksheet of the finished Transportation Finished.xlsx file. Then run SolverTable, allowing the percentage change in all demands to vary from 220% to 30% in increments of 5%, and keep track of total cost. As the table in Figure 5.7 shows, the total shipping cost increases at an increasing rate as the demands increase. However, at some point the problem becomes infeasible. As soon as the total demand is greater than the total capacity, it is impossible to meet all demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>An Alternative Model</strong><br /> The transportation model in Figure 5.3 is a very natural one. In the graphical representation in Figure 5.2, note that all arcs go from left to right, that is, from plants to regions. Therefore, the rectangular range of shipments allows you to calculate shipments out of plants as row sums and shipments into regions as column sums. In anticipation of later models in this chapter, however, where the graphical network can be more complex, we present an alternative model of the transportation problem. (See the file Transportation Alternative Finished.xlsx.)<br /> First, it is useful to introduce some additional network terminology. Recall that flows are the amounts shipped on the various arcs. The direction of the arcs indicates which way the flows are allowed to travel. An arc pointed into a node is called an inflow, whereas an arrow pointed out of a node is called an outflow. In the basic transportation model, all outflows originate from suppliers, and all inflows go toward demanders. However, general networks can have both inflows and outflows for any given node.<br /> With this general structure in mind, the typical network model has one decision variable cell per arc. Its value indicates how much (if any) to send along that arc in the direction of the arrow. Therefore, it is often useful to model network problems by listing all of the arcs and their corresponding flows in one long list. Then constraints can be indicated in a separate section of the spreadsheet. Specifically, for each node in the network, there is a flow balance constraint. These flow balance constraints for the basic transportation model are simply the supply and demand constraints already discussed, but they can be more general for other network models, as will be discussed later in the chapter.<br /> The alternative model of the Grand Prix problem appears in Figure 5.8. The plant and region indexes and the associated unit shipping costs are entered manually in the range A5:C16. Each row in this range corresponds to an arc in the network. For example, row 12 corresponds to the arc from plant 2 to region 4, with unit shipping cost $278. Then the decision variable cells for the flows are in column D. (If there were arc capacities, they could be placed to the right of the flows.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The flow balance constraints are conceptually straightforward. Each cell in the Outflow and Inflow ranges in column G contains the appropriate sum of flows. For example, cell G6, the outflow from plant 1, represents the sum of cells D5 through D8, whereas cell G12, the inflow to plant 1, represents the sum of cells D5, D9, and D13. Fortunately, there is an easy way to enter these summation formulas<span class="tex-text">\(.^{3}\)</span> The trick is to use Excel’s builtin SUMIF function, in the form =SUMIF(CompareRange,Criteria,SumRange). For example, the formula in cell G6 is<br /> =SUMIF(Origin,F6,Flow)<br /> This formula compares the plant number in cell F6 to the Origin range in column A and sums all flows where they are equal—that is, it sums all flows out of plant 1. This formula can be copied down to cell G8 to obtain the flows out of the other plants. For flows into regions, the similar formula in cell G12 for the flow into region 1 is =SUMIF(Destination,F12,Flow)<br /> and this can be copied down to cell G15 for flows into the other regions. In general, the SUMIF function finds all cells in the first argument that satisfy the criterion in the second argument and then sums the corresponding cells in the third argument. It is a very handy function—and not just for network modeling.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: SUMIF<br /> The SUMIF function is useful for summing values in a ertain range if cells in a related range satisfy a given condition. It has the syntax =SUMIF(compareRange,criterion, sumRange), where compareRange and sumRange are similar-size ranges. This formula checks each cell in compareRange to see whether it satisfies the criterion. If it does, it adds the corresponding value in sumRange to the overall sum. For example, =SUMIF(A12:A23,1,D12:D23) sums all values in the range D12:D23 where the corresponding cell in the range A12:A23 has the value 1.<br /> This use of the SUMIF function, along with the list of origins, destinations, unit costs, and flows in columns A through D, is the key to the model. The rest is straightforward. The total cost is a SUMPRODUCT of unit costs and flows, and the Solver dialog box is set up as shown in Figure 5.9.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This alternative model generalizes nicely to other network problems. Essentially, it shows that all network models look alike. There is an additional benefit from this alternative model. Suppose that flows from certain plants to certain regions are not allowed. (Maybe no roads exist.) It is not easy to disallow such routes in the original model. The usual trick is to allow the “disallowed” routes but to impose extremely large unit shipping costs on them. This works, but it is wasteful because it adds decision variable cells that do not really belong in the model. However, the alternative network model simply omits arcs that are not allowed. For example, if the route from plant 2 to region 4 is not allowed, you simply omit the data in the range A12:D12. This creates a model with exactly as many decision variable cells as allowable arcs. This additional benefit can be very valuable when the number of potential arcs in the network is huge—even though the vast majority of them are disallowed—which is exactly the situation in many large network models.</p>

ple transportation problems. In fact, it is probably less natural than the original model in Figure 5.3. However, it paves the way for the more complex network problems discussed later in the chapter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. The customer demands in typical transportation problems can be handled in one of two ways. First, you can think of these forecasted demands as minimal requirements that must be sent to the customers. This is how regional demands were treated here. Alternatively, you could consider the demands as maximal sales quantities, the most each region can sell. Then you would constrain the amounts sent to the regions to be less than or equal to the forecasted demands. In this case, the model would need to provide some incentive to send something through the network. Otherwise, the minimal cost solution would be to send zero units through the network—not very useful! Whether the demand constraints are expressed as “≥” or “≤” (or even “=”) constraints depends on the context of the problem—do the dealers need at least this many, do they need exactly this many, or can they sell only this many?<br /> 2. If all the supplies and demands for a transportation problem are integers, the optimal Solver solution automatically has integer-valued shipments. Explicit integer constraints are not required. This is a very important benefit. It means that the “fast” simplex method can be used rather than much slower integer algorithms.<br /> 3. Shipping costs are often nonlinear (and “nonsmooth”) due to quantity discounts.For example, if it costs $3 per item to ship up to 100 items and $2 per item for each additional item, the proportionality assumption of LP is violated and the resulting transportation model is nonlinear. Shipping problems that involve quantity discounts are generally quite difficult to solve.<br /> 4. Excel’s Solver uses the simplex method to solve transportation problems. There is a streamlined version of the simplex method, called the transportation simplex method, that is much more efficient than the ordinary simplex method for transportation problems. Large transportation problems are usually solved with the transportation simplex method. See Winston (2003) for a discussion of the transportation simplex method. We do not necessarily recommend this more general network model for simple transportation problems. In fact, it is probably less natural than the original model in Figure 5.3. However, it paves the way for the more complex network problems discussed later in the chapter.</p>

5. LeBlanc and Galbreth (2007a, 2007b) discuss a large network model they developed for a client. They indicate that our SUMIF method can be inefficient for really large models. They recommend writing a macro to sum the appropriate flows in and out of nodes.<br /> Extending the basic Grand Prix transportation model is fairly easy, even when the cost structure is considerably more complex. We illustrate one such extension in the following example.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
1:There can even be lower limits, other than zero, on certain flows, but we don’t consider any such limits here.<br /> 2:From here on, we might not remind you about creating range names, but we will continue to list our suggested range names on the spreadsheets.</p>

3:Try entering these formulas manually, even for a 3 × 4 transportation model, and you will see why the SUMIF function is so handy.</p>
