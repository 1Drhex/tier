To get the cash flow for January, we must add the interest from the bank account and subtract the loan payment. The interest on the loan is included in the loan payment and is included when we subtract the loan payment. To get the interest on the bank account, we take the average of the beginning balance and the balance just before payment occurs, which will be approximated by reducing the beginning balance by the labor costs—the only costs that are paid throughout the month. The labor should include labor on the construction projects as well as general overhead labor. The average balance for January is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Average Balance = [Beginning Balance + (Beginning Balance &#8211; Labor)]/2</p>
 <p class="blog">

Interest = $8,687</p>
 <p class="blog">
To get the cash flow for December, we must include the cash distributed to the owners.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This distribution is based on the estimated income taxes for the year, which equals the marginal tax rate times the taxable income. The estimated taxable income equals the revenues (adjusted for changes in overbillings and underbillings) less construction costs less the portion of overhead that is tax deductible less other expenses (namely, interest paid) plus other income (namely, interest received).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The projected revenues need to be adjusted for the change in underbillings and overbillings. It is projected that underbillings (costs and profits in excess of billings) will increase by $10,138 ($15,843 − $5,705) and that overbillings (billings in excess of costs and profits) will decrease by $9,748 ($0 − $9,748). An increase in overbillings decreases revneues; therefore, a decrease in overbillings increases revenues. The adjusted revenue is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Adjusted Revenues = Revenues + Change in Underbillings &#8211; Change in Overbillings</p>
 <p class="blog">
Adjusted Revenues = $6,840,000 + $10,138 &#8211; (-$9,748)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Adjusted Revenues = $6,859,886</p>
 <p class="blog">
For this example, we have assumed that the monthly general overhead costs are paid in the month that they are incurred; therefore, the general overhead is expensed in the same month as its associated cash flow occurs. Because of this, we can calculate the tax deduction by beginning with the cash flow from the general overhead budget and make the necessary adjustments. These adjustments include replacing the cash flow associated with depreciable assets with the assets’ depreciation (including assets whose cash flow occurred in previous years) and deducting nondeductible items (such as half of meals and entertainment). Alternatively, we could have prepared a general overhead budget for use in projecting profits. We would need to prepare a general overhead budget for use in projecting profits if the general overhead budget’s cash flow did not occur in the same month as the expenses. The following adjustments must be made to our general over-head budget to determine how much of the budget is tax deductible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the current overhead calculations, 100% of meals and entertainment has been deducted, whereas only 50% of meals and entertainment is deductible. This will decrease the tax-deductible overhead by 50% of the meals and entertainment cost or $5,202 ($10,404 × 0.50).</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the current overhead calculations, the money spent on a new computer system has been deducted and depreciation has been ignored. The money spent on the computer system must be depreciated over five years using the 200% declining-balance method and the midyear convention. Because the company cannot deduct the cost of the computer system, these costs will decrease the company’s tax-deductible overhead by $18,000. In lieu of writing off the costs, the company may deduct 20% of the purchase price during the first year as depreciation or $3,600 ($18,000 × 0.20). Additionally, the company has $6,000 in depreciation from the previous year’s purchases. Depreciation will increase the company’s tax-deductible overhead by $9,600 ($3,600 + $6,000). T he annual overhead is $524,188. The tax-deductible overhead is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Overhead = $524,188 &#8211; $5,202 &#8211; $18,000 + $9,600</p>
 <p class="blog">
Overhead = $510,586</p>
 <p class="blog">
The taxable income equals the adjusted revenues less construction costs less overhead less interest paid plus interest received, and is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Taxable Income = $6,859,886 &#8211; $6,184,000 &#8211; $510,586 &#8211; $10,900 + $8,687</p>
 <p class="blog">
Taxable Income = $163,087</p>
 <p class="blog">
The estimated taxes are 35.0% of the taxable income or $57,080 ($163,087 × 0.35). The taxable income and estimated taxes may be calculated in spreadsheet format as shown in Figure 3 . There are small differences be-tween the numbers shown in Figure 3 and the calculations in Example 4 , which are due to rounding in the example.</p>

In a spreadsheet, the tax costs could be allocated to the months when tax payments are due; however, this will change the cash flow, which will change the monthly bank account balance, which will change the interest paid during the month, which will change the taxable income and income taxes due, which will change the tax payment. This circular loop can be solved using a spread-sheet. For manual calculations, you would need to see if the changes caused by the circular loop were significant if you were going to spread out the tax payments through-out the year.</p>

The cash flow for December is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{Dec} \)</span>= $33,702 + $838 &#8211; $1,626 &#8211; $57,080</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{Dec} \)</span>= -$24,166</p>
 <p class="blog">
This cash will be withdrawn from the bank account, leaving it with a balance of $226,757 ($250,923 − $24,166). The be-ginning and ending bank account balances, monthly interest, income taxes, and monthly cash flows for the year are shown in Table 19.</p>
