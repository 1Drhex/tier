            <p class="blog"><strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p> <p class="blog">Boston Metal Company (BMC), a manufacturer of various fabricated metal parts, must decide whether to enter the competition to become the supplier of transmissionhousings for Gulf Electric, a company that produces the housings in its own in-house manufacturing facility but has almost reached its maximum production capacity. Therefore, Gulf is looking for an outside supplier. To compete, BMC must design a new fixture for the production process and purchase a new forge. The available details for this purchase are as follows.</p> <ul> <li>The new forge would cost $125,000. This total includes retooling costs for the transmission-housings.</li> <li>If BMC gets the order, it may be able to sell as many as 2,000 units per year to Gulf Electric for $50 each, in which case variable production <span class="tex-text">\(costs,^{3}\)</span> such as direct labor and direct material costs, will be $15 per unit. The increase in fixed <span class="tex-text">\(costs,^{4}\)</span> other than depreciation, will amount to $10,000 per year.</li> <li>The firm expects that the proposed transmission-housings project will have about a five-year product life. The firm also estimates that the amount ordered by Gulf Electric in the first year will be ordered in each of the subsequent four years. (Due to the nature of contracted production, the annual demand and unit price would remain the same over the project after the contract is signed.)</li> <li>The initial investment can be depreciated on a MACRS basis over a seven-year period, and the marginal income-tax rate is expected to remain at 40%. At the end of five years, the forge is expected to retain a market value of about 32% (or $40,000) of the original investment.</li> <li>On the basis of this information, the engineering and marketing staffs of BMC have prepared the cash flow forecasts shown in Table 12.1. Since the NPW is positive ($40,169) at the 15% opportunity cost of capital (MARR), the project appears to be worth undertaking.</li> </ul> <p class="blog"><strong>What Makes BMC Managers Uneasy:</strong> BMC’s managers are uneasy about this project, because too many uncertain elements have not been considered in the analysis.</p> <ul> <li>If BMC decided to take on the project, it would have to invest in the forging machine to provide Gulf Electric with some samples as a part of the bidding process. If Gulf Electric were not to like BMC’s sample, BMC would stand to lose its entire investment in the forging machine.</li> <li>If Gulf were to like BMC’s sample, and if it were overpriced, BMC would be under pressure to bring the price in line with competing firms. Even the possibility that BMC would get a smaller order must be considered, as Gulf may utilize its overtime capacity to produce some extra units. Finally, BMC is not certain about its projections of variable and fixed costs.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">Recognizing these uncertainties, the managers want to assess the various possible future outcomes before making a final decision. Put yourself in BMC’s management position, and describe how you may address the uncertainty associated with the project. In doing so, perform a sensitivity analysis for each variable and develop a sensitivity graph.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Discussion:</strong> Table 12.1 shows BMC’s expected cash flows—but that they will indeed materialize cannot be assumed. In particular, BMC is not very confident in its revenue forecasts. The managers think that if competing firms enter the bidding, BMC will lose a substantial portion of the projected revenues by not being able to increase its bidding price. Before undertaking the project, the company needs to identify the key variables that will determine whether it will succeed or fail. The marketing department has estimated revenue as</p> <p style="text-align: center">Annual revenue = (Product demand)(unit price)<br /> = (2,000)($50) = $100,000</p> <p class="blog">The engineering department has estimated variable costs, such as those of labor and materials, at $15 per unit. Since the projected sales volume is 2,000 units per year, the total variable cost is $30,000.</p> <p class="blog">After first defining the unit sales, unit price, unit variable cost, fixed cost, and salvage value, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to these key input variables. This is done by varying each of the estimates by a given percentage and determining what effect the variation in that item will have on the final results. If the effect is large, the result is sensitive to that item.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/07/table-12-1-768x856.jpg"></div>

<strong>Given:</strong> After-tax cash flow statement based on most likely estimates.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Input variables to which the NPW is most sensitive.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity analysis:</strong> We begin the sensitivity analysis with a consideration of the base-case situation, which reflects the best estimate (expected value) for each input variable. In developing Table 12.2, we changed a given variable by 20% in 5% increments above and below the base-case value and calculated new NPWs, while other variables were held constant. The values for both sales and operating costs were the expected (or base-case) values, and the resulting $40,169 is the base-case NPW. Now we ask a series of “what-if” questions: What if sales are 20% below the expected level? What if operating costs rise? What if the unit price drops from $50 to $45? Table 12.2 summarizes the results of varying the values of the key input variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity graph:</strong> Next, we construct a sensitivity graph for five of the transmissionhousing project’s key input variables. (See Figure 12.1.) We plot the base-case NPW on the ordinate of the graph at the value 1.0 on the abscissa (or 0% deviation). Then we reduce the value of product demand to 0.95 of its base-case value and recompute the NPW with all other variables held at their base-case value. We repeat the process by either decreasing or increasing the relative deviation from the base case. The lines for the variable unit price, variable unit cost, fixed cost, and salvage value are obtained in the same manner. In Figure 12.1, we see that the project’s NPW is (1) very sensitive to changes in product demand and unit price, (2) fairly sensitive to changes in variable costs, and (3) relatively insensitive to changes in the fixed cost and the salvage value.</p>
