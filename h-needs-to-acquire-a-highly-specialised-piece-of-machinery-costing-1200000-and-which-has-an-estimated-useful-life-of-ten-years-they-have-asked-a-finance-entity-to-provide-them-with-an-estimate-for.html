            <p class="blog">H needs to acquire a highly specialised piece of machinery costing $1,200,000 and which has an estimated useful life of ten years. They have asked a finance entity to provide them with an estimate for the cost of acquiring this item. The finance entity has offered the following alternatives:<br /> ● Package 1. A term loan of $1,200,000, commencing on 1 April 20X0. This will be repaid by means of a series of 10 annual repayments of $195,300. The first repayment will be due one year after the loan is granted. This is equivalent to an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum.</p> <p class="blog">● Package 2. The finance entity could purchase the machine and lease it to H for 10 years from 1 April 20X0. H would pay $195,300 per annum with the first payment due on the day that the machine is delivered. The finance entity states that this package is based on an interest rate of 17 per cent per annum. Discounting the lease payments at 17 per cent<br /> gives a net present value of $1,064,496.<br /> The directors of H chose Package 2 on the grounds that it could be treated as an operating lease and would, therefore, have a less damaging effect on the entity’s balance sheet. This was despite the obvious commercial benefits of Package 1.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Show how the acquisition of the machine under each of the two packages would affect H’s income statement for the year ended 31 March 20X1 and balance sheet and their related notes as at that data. Assume that the first instalment was paid on 31 March 20X1.<br /> (b) Use your figures to explain why the directors preferred Package 2.</p>

The total liability outstanding at the end of March 20X1 is $1,124,700. This includes an element of capital that must be repaid during the next twelve months (and is, therefore, a current liability). This liability is equal to the cash repayment scheduled for next year ($195,300) minus the interest element of this payment ($112,470). This difference comes to $82,830.<br /> If short-term liabilities are $82,830 then non-current liabilities must be $1,124,700 -$82,830 = $1,041,870.<br /> Package 2<br /> Income statement extracts<br /> . $<br /> Finance charge 195,300<br /> Notes to the income statement<br /> The entity is committed to paying $195,300 in the forthcoming year. This in respect of an operating lease which will continue for more than five years.<br /> (b) The directors of H prefer Package 2 because they believe that it can be treated as an operating lease. If this treatment can be justified then there is no need to capitalise the asset or to show the lease as a liability in the balance sheet. This will make the entity appear to have a lower capital employed and will, therefore, increase the return on capital employed ratio. It will also make the entity appear to have less borrowing, thereby improving the gearing ratio.<br /> It should be stressed that both packages appear to impose very similar obligations and costs on H. It could be argued that Package 2 should be treated as a finance lease too. Thus, the directors are choosing on the basis of the most attractive treatment in the financial statements rather than the most logical commercial decision.</p>
