            <p class="blog">Hub Location at Western Airlines</p> <p class="blog">Western Airlines wants to design a hub system in the United States. Each hub is used for connecting flights to and from cities within 1000 miles of the hub. Western runs flights among the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. The company wants to determine the smallest number of hubs it needs to cover all these cities, where a city is covered if it is within 1000 miles of at least one hub. Table 6.4 lists which cities are within 1000 miles of other cities.</p> <p class="blog">Table 6.4 Data for the Western Set-Covering Example:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 396px; height: 300px;" border="0" width="144" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Cities Within 1000 Miles</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, CH, HO, NO, NY, PI</td> <td dir="LTR">Atlanta (AT)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">BO, NY, PI</td> <td dir="LTR">Boston (BO)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, CH, NY, NO, PI</td> <td dir="LTR">Chicago (CH)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">DE, SL</td> <td dir="LTR">Denver (DE)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, HO, NO</td> <td dir="LTR">Houston (HO)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">LA, SL, SF</td> <td dir="LTR">Los Angeles (LA)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, CH, HO, NO</td> <td dir="LTR">New Orleans (NO)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, BO, CH, NY, PI</td> <td dir="LTR">New York (NY)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">AT, BO, CH, NY, PI</td> <td dir="LTR">Pittsburgh (PI)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">DE, LA, SL, SF, SE</td> <td dir="LTR">Salt Lake City (SL)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">LA, SL, SF, SE</td> <td dir="LTR">San Francisco (SF)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19"> SL, SF, SE</td> <td dir="LTR">Seattle (SE)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To develop a binary model to find the minimum number of hub locations that can cover all cities.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> Western has evidently made a policy decision that its hubs will cover only cities within a<br /> 1000-mile radius.

The variables and constraints for this set-covering model appear in Figure 6.21. (See the file Locating Hubs Big Picture.xlsx.) The model is straightforward. There is a binary variable for each city to indicate whether a hub is located there. Then the number of hubs that cover each city is constrained to be at least 1. There are no monetary costs in this version of the problem. The objective is simply to minimize the number of hubs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model for Western is shown in Figure 6.22. (See the file Locating Hubs Finished.xlsx.) The model can be developed as follows:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the information from Table 6.4 in the light blue range. A 1 in a cell indicates that the column city covers the row city, whereas a 0 indicates that the column city does not cover the row city. For example, the three 1’s in row 7 indicate that Boston, New York, and Pittsburgh are the only cities within 1000 miles of Boston.<br /> 2) 0–1 values for hub locations. Enter any trial 0–1 values in the Used_as_hub range to indicate which cities are used as hubs. These are the decision variable cells.<br /> 3) Cities covered by hubs. Determine the number of hubs that cover each city. Specifically, calculate the total number of hubs within 1000 miles of Atlanta in cell B25 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B6:M6,Used_as_hub)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For any 0–1 values in the decision variable cells, this formula finds the number of hubs that cover Atlanta. Then copy this to the rest of the Hubs_covered_by range. Note that a value in the Hubs_covered_by range can be 2 or greater. This indicates that a city is within 1000 miles of multiple hubs.<br /> 4) Number of hubs. Calculate the total number of hubs used in cell B39 with the formula<br /> =SUM(Used_as_hub)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 6.23. The objective is to minimize the total number of hubs, subject to covering each city by at least one hub and ensuring that the decision variable cells are binary. As usual, you should select the Simplex LP method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> Figure 6.24 is a graphical representation of the optimal solution, where the double ovals indicate hub locations and the large circles indicate ranges covered by the hubs. (These large circles are not drawn to scale. In reality, they should be circles of radius 1000 miles centered at the hubs.) Three hubs—in Houston, New York, and Salt Lake City—are needed.6 Would you have guessed this? The Houston hub covers Houston, Atlanta, and New Orleans. The New York hub covers Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Boston, New York, and Chicago. The Salt Lake City hub covers Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle. Note that Atlanta is the only city covered by two hubs; it can be serviced by New York or Houston.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> An interesting sensitivity analysis for Western’s problem is to see how the solution is affected by the mile limit. Currently, a hub can service all cities within 1000 miles. What if the limit were 800 or 1200 miles, say? To answer this question, data on actual distances among all the cities must be collected. After you have a matrix of these distances, you can build the 0–1 matrix, corresponding to the range B6:M17 in Figure 6.22, with IF functions. The modified model appears in the file Locating Hubs with Distances Finished.xlsx (not shown here). You can check that the typical formula in B24 is =IF(B8&lt;=$B$4,1,0), which is then copied to the rest of the B24:M35 range.7 You can then run SolverTable, selecting cell B4 as the single input cell, letting it vary from 800 to 1200 in increments of 100, and keeping track of where the hubs are located and the number of hubs. The SolverTable results in Figure 6.25 show the effect of the mile limit. When this limit is lowered to 800 miles, four hubs are required, but when it is increased to 1100 or 1200, only two hubs are required. By the way, the solution shown for the 1000-mile limit is different from the previous solution in Figure 6.22 (because of multiple optimal solutions), but it still requires three hubs.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
6:Multiple optimal solutions exist for this model, all requiring three hubs, so you might obtain a different solution<br /> from ours.</p>
