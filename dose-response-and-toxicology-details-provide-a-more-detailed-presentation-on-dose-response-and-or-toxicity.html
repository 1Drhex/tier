Dose-response assessment is the process of characterizing the relation between the dose of an agent administered or received and the incidence of an adverse health effect in exposed populations, and estimating the incidence of the effect as a function of exposure to the agent. This process considers such important factors as intensity of exposure, age pattern of exposure, and other possible variables that might affect responses such as sex, lifestyle, and other modifying factors. A dose-response assessment usually requires extrapolation from high to low doses and extrapolation from animals to humans, or even one laboratory animal species to a wildlife species. A dose-response assessment should describe and justify the methods of extrapolation used to predict incidence, and it should characterize the statistical and biological uncertainties in these methods. As noted, when possible, the uncertainties should be described numerically rather than qualitatively.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Toxicologists tend to focus their attention primarily on extrapolations from cancer bioassays. However, there is also a need to evaluate the risks of lower doses to see how they affect the various organs and systems in the body. Many scientific papers focus on the use of a safety factor or uncertainty factor approach since all adverse effects other than cancer and mutation-based developmental effects are believed to have a threshold â€” a dose below which no adverse effect should occur. Several researchers have discussed various approaches to setting acceptable daily intakes or exposure limits for developmental and reproductive toxicants. It is thought that an acceptable limit of exposure could be determined using cancer models, but today they are considered inappropriate because of thresholds [1,13].</p>

Dangers are not necessarily defined by the presence of a particular chemical, but rather by the amount of that substance one is exposed to, also known as the aforementioned dose. A dose is usually expressed in milligrams of chemical received per kilogram of body weight per day. For toxic substances other than carcinogens, a threshold dose must be exceeded before a health effect will occur, and for many substances, there is a dosage below which there is no harm; i.e., a health effect will occur or at least will be detected at the threshold. For carcinogens, it is assumed that there is no threshold, and, therefore, any substance that produces cancer is assumed to produce cancer at any concentration. It is vital to establish the link to cancer and to determine if that risk is acceptable. Analyses of cancer risks are much more complex than those for non-cancer risks.</p>

For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to precisely evaluate toxic responses caused by acute exposures to hazardous materials. First, humans experience a wide range of acute adverse health effects including irritation, narcosis, asphyxiation, sensitization, blindness, organ system damage, and death. In addition, the severity of many of these effects varies with intensity and duration of exposure. Second, there is a high degree of variation in response among individuals in a typical population. Third, for the overwhelming majority of substances encountered in industry, there is insufficient data on toxic responses of humans to permit an accurate or precise assessment of the substanceâ€™s health potential. Fourth, many releases involve multiple components. There are presently no rules on how these types of releases should be evaluated. Fifth, there are no toxicology testing protocols that exist for studying episodic releases on animals. In general, this has been a neglected area of toxicology research. However, there are many useful measures available to employ as benchmarks for predicting the likelihood that a release event will result in serious injury or death.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Not all contaminants or chemicals are equal in their capacity to cause adverse effects. Thus, some clean-up standards or action levels are based in part on the compoundsâ€™ toxicological properties. Toxicity data employed are derived largely from animal experiments in which the animals (primarily mice and rats) are exposed to increasingly higher concentrations or doses. As described above, responses or effects can vary widely from no observable effect to temporary and reversible effects, to permanent injury to organs, to chronic functional impairment, and ultimately death.</p>
