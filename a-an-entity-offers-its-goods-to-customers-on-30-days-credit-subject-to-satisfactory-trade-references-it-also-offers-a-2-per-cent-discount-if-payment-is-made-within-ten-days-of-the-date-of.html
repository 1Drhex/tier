(a) (i) On the policy as described, the entity is offering 2 per cent for 20 days, i.e. 36.5 per cent per annum using simple interest. In accounting terms, the cost to the entity is 2 per cent of the sales in respect of which the discount is taken, but it will show correspondingly lower receivables. Assume sales of $1,000 per day, for simplicity:</p>
 <p class="blog">
the discount would cost $7,300 per annum, but receivables would be $20,000 lower, 7,300/20,000 = 36.5 per cent. The cost of offering a cash discount should ideally be calculated using a compounded annual rate. In this example, the compounded annual rate is given by:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( (\frac{100}{98} )^{365/20}-1=1.446 &#8211; 1 = 44.6\)</span>%</p>
 <p class="blog">
This can be compared with the entity’s cost of capital to arrive at an opportunity cost.<br /> (ii) The offering of a discount to customers is normally influenced by practice in the industry/trade in question and may therefore be unavoidable in principle although subject to customisation, firm by firm. The benefits (compared with factoring) are attributable to the maintenance of a direct relationship with the customer. In these days of developing long-term relationships, this can be very important. Also, sales ledger clerks and managers can pick up useful ‘intelligence’ from their contacts and head off potential problems, including bad debts, and all managers are prompted to think about the time value of money. There is a cost, however, that is not limited to the actual discount: keeping on top of the situation (e.g. reacting quickly to lapses) can be costly, though the latest computer systems have eliminated the need for clerks to go through ledgers.<br /> Factoring, on the other hand, takes the administration of the sales ledger away from the entity and exploits the economies of scale and expertise of the specialists. Different payment terms can be negotiated, for example, some payment immediately on invoicing, thereby releasing further working capital, and/or the guaranteeing of payment. A particular advantage of this approach is that receipts are more predictable: customers may or may not pay in time to earn their discount, but the factor must pay to terms. There is a cost, of course, in respect of the administration and financing, and it must be acknowledged that the factor can be a barrier between the entity and its customers. A ‘confidential invoice discounting’ service can be an effective compromise.<br /> Experience suggests that, thanks to avoiding double handling, a well-run sales accounting function adds value to a business; factoring is primarily attractive to entities who cannot raise funds from more traditional sources.</p>

(iii) An entity might raise funds on the strength of its receivables by:<br /> ● arranging a bank loan or overdraft on terms that require a certain minimum receivables figure (or working capital generally) to be maintained;<br /> ● setting up a separate entity, funded by the bank, which owns the receivables.<br /> (b) Some working capital is essential to the process, e.g. where different crops are blended or need time to mature or incubate. Some, such as trade credit, is a straight trade-off between cost and investment. The remainder, to which the question addresses itself, is determined by uncertainty and the response thereto. Take, for example, a business that chooses to sell from inventory, rather than to order. Its production plan is going to be based on a forecast of demand, but the latter must be subject to a margin of error. Should the entity plan to carry enough inventory to meet the maximum demand, with all that entails in terms of holding costs? Or should it carry enough to meet the minimum, with all that means in terms of lost business and hence contribution? Put in that way, it is clear that a rational business will seek to optimise, to produce to the point where incremental holding cost equates with incremental contribution. Different degrees of sophistication are applied, e.g. some work on three numbers – lowest, highest, and most likely – while others use probability curves. The difficult part in practice is assessing the value of lost contribution: what future orders might be lost, owing to customer dissatisfaction? The terms ‘aggressive … conservative … moderate’ mean different things to different people but could correspond to preparing to meet maximum demand, minimum demand, or something in between. Alternatively, if we characterise aggressive as being prepared to shoulder a greater risk, it would be associated with lowering cash and inventory, but raising receivables.<br /> Modern financial practice does not think in terms of current assets (an accounting term, after all), being financed separately from fixed assets and revenue investments – rather the focus is on projected cash flows and the margin of error therein. However, there are some empirical relationships, e.g. businesses with a high proportion of current (as opposed to fixed or intangible) assets that are likely to be able to attract a higher proportion of their funds in the form of bank overdraft finance. On a different axis, those with wide margins of error in sales forecasts are likely to find it difficult to attract such finance. The scales on these axes have changed considerably over recent years as banks have ‘burned their fingers’ on loans they thought were safe, but were not.<br /> The link between the investment needs and the funding pattern of a business boils down to the familiar relationship between risk and reward. The more conservative the policy (as defined above) the lower the return, but the lower the risk associated with it.</p>
