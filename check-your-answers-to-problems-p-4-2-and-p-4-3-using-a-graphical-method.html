Truss of : The support reactions have been calculated in S.4.2 and are as shown in Fig. S.4.10(a); the spaces between the members and forces are now numbered.<br /> Starting at joint A and moving in a clockwise sense round joint A the vector 12 is drawn vertically downwards and is equal to 30 kN to a suitable scale. The vector 25 is drawn parallel to AG and intersects the vector 51, which is horizontal, at 5. The vector 25, equal to 37.5 kN, acts away from A so that AG is in tension. The vector 51, equal to 22.5 kN, acts towards A so that AB is in compression.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now moving in a clockwise sense round joint B the vector 41 is drawn vertically upwards to represent 20 kN. The vector 15 has already been drawn and the vector 56 is vertical so that the point 6 is located by the intersection of this vector with the horizontal vector 64. Then, BG=-20 kN (vector 56) and BC=-22.5 kN (vector 64).</p>
 <p class="blog">
At joint H the vector 72 is horizontal as is the vector 28. Further, the vector 87 is vertical but since 72 and 28 are both horizontal the vector 87 must be zero in length and the points 7 and 8 therefore coincide. From the force polygon HG=30.0 kN (72) and HJ=30.0 kN (28), HC=0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We now move to joint C where the point 9 is located by drawing the vectors 89, parallel to CJ, and 94 horizontally through 4. Then, CJ=12.5 kN (89), CG=-12.5 kN (67) and CD=-37.5 (94).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The point 10 is found by drawing the vectors 2 10 (horizontal) and 9 10 (vertical). JK=37.5 kN (2 10) and JD=-10.0 kN (9 10).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Point 11 is found by drawing the vectors 11 4 horizontally and 10 11 parallel to DK. Then,<br /> DK=12.5 kN (10 11) and DE=-45 kN (11 4).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The point 3 is located by drawing the vector 23 vertically downwards and equal to 60 kN. The point 12 is positioned at the intersection of the vertical through 11 and the horizontal through 3.<br /> Then, KE=-70 kN (11 12), EF=-45 kN (12 3) and KF=75 kN (12 2).<br /> Truss of : The reactions have been calculated in S.4.3 and are shown in Fig. S.4.10(c); The spaces between the loads and members are now numbered.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Starting at joint A the vector 12 is drawn vertically upwards to represent the 15 kN reaction (Fig. S.4.10(d)). The point 6 is located at the intersection of 16 (horizontal) and 26 (parallel to AC). Then, AC=-30 kN (26) and AP=26 kN (61).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Moving to joint C the vector 23 is drawn to represent the 10 kN load and the point 7 is found by drawing 37 (parallel to EC) and 76 (parallel to CP). CP=-8.7 kN (76) and CE=-25 kN (37).<br /> At P, 78 is drawn parallel to PE and 81 drawn parallel to PF, hence the point 8. Then, PE=8.7 kN (78) and PF=17.3 kN (81).</p>
 <p class="blog">
We now cannot move to joints E, F, G or H since there are more than two unknowns at each of these joints. Therefore moving to joint B, the vector 51 is drawn vertically upwards to represent the 15 kN reaction. Now 1 12 is horizontal and 12 5 is vertical so that the points 1 and 12 must coincide; Then, FB=0 (1 12) and BJ=-15 kN (12 5). The point 11 is found by drawing 11 5 parallel to GJ and 12 11 parallel to JH. This gives JH=26 kN (12 11) and GJ=-15 kN (11 5).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Considering joint G the point 4 is located by drawing the vector 45 vertically downwards to represent the 10 kN load. Then, point 10 is the intersection of 10 4 (parallel to EG) and 11 10 (parallel to HG). This gives EG=-20 kN (10 4) and GH=-8.7 kN (11 10). Finally point 9 is the intersection of 12 9 (parallel to HF) and 89 (parallel to EF) or the intersection of either of these two with 10 9 (parallel to EH). Therefore, EH=8.7 kN (9 10), EF=-17.3 kN (89), HF=17.3 kN (12 9).</p>
