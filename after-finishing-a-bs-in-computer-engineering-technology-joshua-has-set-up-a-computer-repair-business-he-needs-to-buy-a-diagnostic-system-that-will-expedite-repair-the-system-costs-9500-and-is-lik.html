            <p class="blog">After finishing a BS in computer engineering technology, Joshua has set up a computer repair business. He needs to buy a diagnostic system that will expedite repair. The system costs $9,500 and is likely to generate $3,750 per year. Since his current loans are excessive, no financial institution is interested in lending him any more money. He discussed the difficulty of raising the capital with his rich uncle who happens to be generous. His uncle agrees to lend him $9,500 at 4% simple interest provided Joshua pays him the interest annually on time. How much will Joshua earn annually by investing in the system after paying the interest to his uncle?</p>

<span class="fontstyle0">Let us go through each of the six steps.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 1 <span class="tex-text">\(Comprehend\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Note that the loan earns simple interest. It is not clear when Joshua is to pay back his uncle the $9,500 loan; the problem statement is vague about it. But do we really need this information to solve the problem? Not really. Note that the interest for the year is paid annually on the loan anniversary. This payment must be subtracted from the annual income of $3,750.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 2 <span class="tex-text">\(Data\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The given data are:</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(P=9,500\$\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\( i=4\%\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(n=1\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Remember to use the fractional value of the interest rate, i.e., </span><span class="fontstyle2">i </span><span class="fontstyle0">= 4/100 = 0.04.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 3 <span class="tex-text">\(Unknown\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The unknown here is the annual earning after paying for the interest.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 4 <span class="tex-text">\(Process\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Since the annual income from the use of the system is given, we need to determine the annual interest to evaluate the unknown. Shall we follow the first-principles? Or is there an equation that relates the earned interest I with P, </span><span class="fontstyle2">i</span><span class="fontstyle0">, and n? Yes indeed, there is one—Equation (1.1) discussed earlier. Which of the two—first-principles or Equation (1.1)—yields an easier solution? Here, it does not matter; both are equally effective. So let us use Equation (1.1).</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
I = P i n</p>
 <p class="blog">
where,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">P = principal<br /> i = interest rate (in fraction) per period<br /> n = number of periods</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 5 <span class="tex-text">\(Solve\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The interest for the year can be found from Equation (1.1),<br /> with n = 1, as</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Thus, Joshua will pay his uncle each year $380 on the loan anniversary. Since his income from the diagnostic system is $3,750 per year, the annual saving will be<br /> </span></p>
 <p class="blog">
=<span class="tex-text">\(3,750\$ -380\$ \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
=<span class="tex-text">\(3,370\$\)</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 6 <span class="tex-text">\(Confirm\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Let us check if the answer seems correct. As it is a simple problem, we can do it in our “heads.” The principal is $9,500. If the interest rate were 1%, the interest for the year would be $95. This $95 can be rounded to $100 to aid the mental arithmetic. So for an interest rate of 4% (four times as high), the approximate interest for the year should be four times of $100, i.e., $400. Thus, the value of I at step 5 as $380 seems alright</span><span class="fontstyle0">8 </span><span class="fontstyle0">since it is closer to the mentally-worked-out approximate value of $400.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The usefulness of the six-step procedure might not have been quite obvious in the previous illustration. Try applying it to other problems of the text. Frequent use of the procedure will hone your skills and confirm its usefulness.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Do we have to follow the six-step procedure in a very formal way, as illustrated? Not really. But keeping the procedure in mind while solving problems is likely to be helpful.</span></p>
