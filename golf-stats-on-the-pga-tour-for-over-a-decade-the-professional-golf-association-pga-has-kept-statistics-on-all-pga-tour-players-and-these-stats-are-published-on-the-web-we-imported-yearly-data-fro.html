            <p class="blog"><strong>GOLF STATS ON THE PGA TOUR</strong></p> <p class="blog">For over a decade, the Professional Golf Association (PGA) has kept statistics on all PGA Tour players, and these stats are published on the Web. We imported yearly data from 2003–2017 into the file Golf Stats.xlsx. The file includes an observation for each of the top 200 earners for each year, including age, earnings, events played, rounds played, 36-hole cuts made (only the top scorers on Thursday and Friday get to play on the weekend; the others don’t make the cut), top 10s, and wins. It also includes stats about efficiency in the various parts of the game (driving, putting, greens in regulation, and sand saves), as well as good holes (eagles and birdies) and bad holes (bogies). A sample of the data for 2017 appears in Figure 3.11, with the data sorted in decreasing order of earnings and a few variables not shown. What relationships can be uncovered in these data for any particular year?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use scatterplots to search for relationships in the golf data.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2022/01/3.3-1-768x185.png"></div>

This example is typical in that there are many numeric variables, and it is up to you to search for possible relationships. A good first step is to ask some interesting questions and then try to answer them with scatterplots. For example, do younger players play more events? Are earnings related to age? Which is related most strongly to earnings: driving, putting, or greens in regulation? Do the answers to these questions remain the same from year to year? This example is all about exploring the data, and we will answer only a few of the questions that could be asked. Fortunately, scatterplots are easy to create, so you can do a lot of exploring very quickly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Scatterplots are great for initial exploration of the data. If a scatterplot suggests a relationship between two variables, other methods can then be used to examine this relationship in more depth.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To create a scatterplot, you highlight any two variables of interest and select a scatter chart of the top left type from the Insert ribbon. At this point, you will probably want to modify the chart by deleting the legend, inserting some titles, and possibly changing some formatting. Also, you might want to swap the roles of the X and Y variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Selecting Multiple Ranges Efficiently</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
How do you select two long variables such as Age and Earnings? Here are the steps that make it easy. (1) Select the Age label in cell B1. (2) Hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and press the down arrow key. This selects the Age column. (3) Hold down the Ctrl key and select the Earnings label in cell H1. (4) Hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and press the down arrow key. Now both columns are selected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Several scatterplots appear in Figures 3.12 through 3.15. The scatterplots in Figure 3.12 indicate the possibly surprising results that age is practically unrelated to the number of events played and earnings. Each scatter is basically a shapeless swarm of points, and a shapeless swarm always indicates “no relationship.” The scatterplots in Figure 3.13 confirm what you would expect. Specifically, players who play in more events tend to earn more, although there are a number of exceptions to this pattern. Also, players who make more 36-hole cuts tend to earn more.</p>

<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Data Labels in Scatterplots</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Unfortunately, there is no automatic way to enter a label such as “Dustin Johnson” next to a point in a scatterplot. If you click twice on a point (don’t double-click, but slowly click twice), you can select this point. Then if you right-click, you have the option of adding a data label. However, this data label is always the value of the Y variable. In this case, it would be Dustin’s earnings, not his name.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Golfers will be particularly interested in the scatterplots in Figures 3.14 and 3.15. The scatterplots in Figure 3.14 indicate a slight positive relationship between earnings and driving length (yards per drive) but almost no relationship between earnings and driving accuracy (percentage of fairways hit). The scatterplots in Figure 3.15 indicate a slight positive relationship between earnings and greens hit in regulation and a negative relationship between earnings and putting average. Does this mean that better putters earn less? Absolutely not! The putting stat is the average number of putts per hole, so a lower value is better. Therefore, the downward relationship indicated in the chart is expected. In fact, the driving and putting scatterplots tend to confirm the old saying in golf: Drive for show, putt for dough.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You could obviously ask many more questions about the relationships in this golf data set and then attempt to answer them with scatterplots. For example, are the relationships (or lack of them) in the scatterplots consistent through the years? Or would it be better to use Earnings per Round instead of Earnings as the Y variable? Or are there other variables not shown here, such as the percentage of holed putts of less than 10 feet, that are more highly related to Earnings? You now have a powerful tool, scatterplots, for examining relationships, and the tool is easy to implement. We urge you to use it—a lot.</p>
