The idea is that each hospital should be shown in its best possible light. That is, the inputs and outputs should be valued in such a way that a given hospital looks as good as possible relative to the other hospitals. Specifically, to determine whether a hospital is efficient, the model determines a price per unit of each output and a cost per unit of each input. Then the efficiency of a hospital is defined as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(Efficiency of hospital =\frac {Value of hospital’s outputs}{Value of hospital’s inputs}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The DEA approach uses the following four ideas to determine whether a hospital is efficient.<br /> ■ No hospital can be more than 100% efficient. Therefore, the efficiency of each hospital is constrained to be less than or equal to 1. To make this a linear constraint, it is expressed in the form</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Value of hospital’s outputs ≤ Value of hospital’s inputs</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"> ■ When determining whether a hospital is efficient, it is useful to scale input prices so that the value of the hospital’s inputs equals 1. Any other value would suffice, but using 1 causes the efficiency of the hospital to be equal to the value of the hospital’s outputs.<br /> ■ To put a given hospital in its best light, the input costs and output prices should be chosen to maximize this hospital’s efficiency. If the hospital’s efficiency equals 1, the hospital is efficient; if the hospital’s efficiency is less than 1, the hospital is inefficient.<br /> ■ All input costs and output prices must be nonnegative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Putting these ideas together, the variables required for the DEA model are shown in Figure 4.47. (See the file Hospital DEA Big Picture.xlsx.) Note the reference to “selected hospital.” The model is actually analyzed three times, once for each hospital. So the selected hospital each time is the one currently in focus.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> Figure 4.48 contains the DEA spreadsheet model used to determine the efficiency of hospital 1. (See the file Hospital DEA Finished.xlsx.) To develop this model, proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Input given data and name ranges. Enter the input and output information for each hospital in the ranges B6:C8 and F6:H8 and name the various ranges as indicated.<br /> 2) Selected hospital. Enter 1, 2, or 3 in cell B3, depending on which hospital you want to analyze. (You will eventually analyze all three.)<br /> 3) Unit input costs and output prices. Enter any trial values for the input costs and output prices in the Unit_costs_of_inputs and Unit_prices_of_outputs ranges.<br /> 4) Total input costs and output values. In the Input_costs range, calculate the cost of the inputs used by each hospital. To do this, enter the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Unit_costs_of_inputs,B6:C6)<br /> in cell B14 for hospital 1, and copy this to the rest of the Input_costs range for the other hospitals. Similarly, calculate the output values by entering the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Unit_prices_of_outputs,F6:H6)<br /> in cell D14 and copying it to the rest of the Output_values range. Note that even though the focus is currently on hospital 1’s efficiency, you still need to calculate input costs and output values for the other hospitals so that you have something to compare hospital 1 to.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Total input cost and output value for the selected hospital. In row 19, constrain the total input cost of the selected hospital to be 1 by entering the formula<br /> =VLOOKUP(Selected_hospital,A14:B16,2)<br /> in cell B19, and enter a 1 in cell D19. Similarly, enter the formula<br /> =VLOOKUP(Selected_hospital,A14:D16,4)<br /> in cell B22. (Make sure you understand how these VLOOKUP functions work.) Remember that because the selected hospital’s input cost is constrained to be 1, its output value in cell B22 is automatically its efficiency.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver to Determine Whether Hospital 1 Is Efficient</strong><br /> To determine whether hospital 1 is efficient, use Solver as follows. When you are finished, the Solver dialog box should appear as shown in Figure 4.49.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Objective. Select cell B22 as the objective cell to maximize. Because the cost of hospital 1 inputs is constrained to be 1, this causes Solver to maximize the efficiency of hospital 1.<br /> 2) Decision variable cells. Choose the Unit_costs_of_inputs and Unit_prices_of_outputs ranges as the decision variable cells.<br /> 3) Selected hospital’s input cost constraint. Add the constraint Selected_hospital_input_cost=1. This sets the total value of hospital 1’s inputs equal to 1.<br /> 4) Efficiency constraint. Add the constraint Input_costs&gt;=Output_values. This ensures that no hospital is more than 100% efficient.<br /> 5) Specify nonnegativity and optimize. Check the Non-Negative option and the Simplex LP method, and then solve to obtain the optimal solution shown in Figure 4.48.<br /> The 1 in cell B22 of this solution means that hospital 1 is efficient. In words, Solver has found a set of unit costs for the inputs and the unit prices for the outputs such that the total value of hospital 1’s outputs equals the total cost of its inputs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Determining Whether Hospitals 2 and 3 Are Efficient</strong><br /> To determine whether hospital 2 is efficient, simply replace the value in cell B3 by 2 and rerun Solver. The Solver settings do not need to be modified. The optimal solution appears in Figure 4.50. From the value of 0.773 in cell B22, you can see that hospital 2 is not efficient. Similarly, you can determine that hospital 3 is efficient by replacing the value in cell B3 by 3 and rerunning Solver (see Figure 4.51).<br /> In summary, the Solver results imply that hospitals 1 and 3 are efficient, but hospital 2 is inefficient.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>What Does It Mean to Be Efficient or Inefficient?</strong><br /> This idea of efficiency or inefficiency might still be a mystery, so let’s consider it further. A hospital is efficient if the inputs and outputs can be priced in such a way that this hospital gets out all of the value that it puts in. The pricing scheme depends on the hospital. Each hospital tries to price inputs and outputs to put its operations in the best possible light. In the example, hospital 1 attaches 0 prices to input 1 (hospital beds) and output 3 (patient-days for patients over 65), and it attaches positive prices to the rest. This makes hospital 1 look efficient. Hospital 3, which is also efficient, also attaches 0 prices to input 1 and output 3, but its prices for the others are somewhat different from hospital 1’s prices.<br /> If DEA finds that a hospital is inefficient, there is no pricing scheme where that hospital can recover its entire input costs in output values. Actually, it can be shown that if a hospital is inefficient, then a combination of the efficient hospitals can be found that uses no more inputs than the inefficient hospital, yet produces at least as much of each output as the inefficient hospital. In this sense, the hospital is inefficient.<br /> To see how this combination can be found, consider the spreadsheet model in Figure 4.52. Begin by entering any positive weights in the Weights range. For any such weights (they don’t even need to sum to 1), consider the combination hospital as a fraction of hospital 1 and another fraction of hospital 3. For example, with the weights shown, the combination hospital uses about 26% of the inputs and produces about 26% of the outputs of hospital 1, and it uses about 66% of the inputs and produces about 66% of the outputs of hospital 3. When they are combined in row 6 with the SUMPRODUCT function [for example, the formula in cell D6 is =SUMPRODUCT(Weights,D4:D5)], you can see the quantities of inputs this combination hospital uses and the quantities of outputs it produces. To find weights where the combination hospital is better than hospital 2, it suffices to find any feasible solution to the inequalities indicated in rows 6 to 8, and this can be done by using the Solver setup in Figure 4.53. (The weights in Figure 4.52 do the job.) Note that there is no objective to maximize or minimize; all you want is a solution that satisfies the constraints. Furthermore, there is guaranteed to be a feasible solution because hospital 2 has already been identified as inefficient.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In reality, after DEA analysis identifies an organizational unit as being inefficient, this unit should consider benchmarking itself relative to the competition to see where it can make more efficient use of its inputs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. The ratio (input i cost)/(input j cost) can be interpreted as the marginal rate of substitution (at the optimal solution) of input i for input j. That is, the same level of outputs can be maintained if the use of input i decreases by a small amount Δ and the use of input j increases by [(input i cost)/(input j cost)] Δ . For example, for hospital 2, (input 2 cost/input 1 cost) = 6700. This implies that if the use of input 2 decreases<br /> by a small amount Δ, hospital 2 can maintain its current output levels if the usage of input 1 increases by 6700Δ.<br /> 2. The ratio (output i price)/(output j price) can be interpreted as the marginal rate of substitution (at the optimal solution) of output i for output j. That is, the same level of input usage can be maintained if the production of output i decreases by a small amount Δ and the production of output j increases by [(output i price)/(output j price)]Δ. For example, for hospital 2, (output 2 price)/(output 1 price) =5 0.67. This implies that if the use of output 2 decreases by a small amount Δ, hospital 2 can maintain its current resource usage if the production of output 1 increases by 0.67Δ.</p>
