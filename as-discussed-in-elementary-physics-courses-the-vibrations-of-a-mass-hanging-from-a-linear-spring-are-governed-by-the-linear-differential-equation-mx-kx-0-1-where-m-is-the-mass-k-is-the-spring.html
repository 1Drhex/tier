As you probably recall, it&#8217;s easy to solve (1) analytically in terms of sines and cosines. But that&#8217;s precisely what makes linear equations so special! For the nonlinear equations of ultimate interest to us, it&#8217;s usually impossible to find an analytical solution. We want to develop methods for deducing the behavior of equations like (1) without actually solving them.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The motion in the phase plane is determined by a vector field that comes from the differential equation (1). To find this vector field, we note that the state of the system is characterized by its current position <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> and velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>; if we know the values of both <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>, then (1) uniquely determines the future states of the system. Therefore we rewrite (1) in terms of <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>, as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&amp;\dot{ X }=v (2a)\\&amp;\dot{v}=-\frac{k}{m} x . (2b)\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Equation ( <span class="tex-text">\(2 a )\)</span> is just the definition of velocity, and (2b) is the differential equation (1) rewritten in terms of <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>. To simplify the notation, let <span class="tex-text">\(\omega^{2}=k / m\)</span>. Then (2) becomes</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&amp;\dot{x}=v (3a)\\&amp;\dot{v}=-\omega^{2} x. (3b)\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The system <span class="tex-text">\((3)\)</span> assigns a vector <span class="tex-text">\((\dot{x}, \dot{v})=\left(v,-\omega^{2} x\right)\)</span> at each point <span class="tex-text">\((x, v)\)</span>, and therefore represents a vector field on the phase plane.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For example, let&#8217;s see what the vector field looks like when we&#8217;re on the <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span>-axis. Then <span class="tex-text">\(v=0\)</span> and so <span class="tex-text">\((\dot{x}, \dot{v})=\left(0,-\omega^{2} x\right)\)</span>. Hence the vectors point vertically downward for positive <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> and vertically upward for negative <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> (Figure 5.1.2). As <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> gets larger in magnitude, the vectors <span class="tex-text">\(\left(0,-\omega^{2} x\right)\)</span> get longer. Similarly, on the <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span>-axis, the vector field is <span class="tex-text">\((\dot{x}, \dot{v})=(v, 0)\)</span>, which points to the right when <span class="tex-text">\(v&gt;0\)</span> and to the left when <span class="tex-text">\(v&lt;0\)</span>. As we move around in phase space, the vectors change direction as shown in Figure 5.1.2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Just as in Chapter 2, it is helpful to visualize the vector field in terms of the motion of an imaginary fluid. In the present case, we imagine that a fluid is flowing steadily on the phase plane with a local velocity given by <span class="tex-text">\((\dot{x}, \dot{v})=\left(v,-\omega^{2} x\right)\)</span>. Then, to find the trajectory starting at <span class="tex-text">\(\left(x_{0}, v_{0}\right)\)</span>, we place an imaginary particle or phase point at <span class="tex-text">\(\left(x_{0}, v_{0}\right)\)</span> and watch how it is carried around by the flow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The flow in Figure 5.1.2 swirls about the origin. The origin is special, like the eye of a hurricane: a phase point placed there would remain motionless, because <span class="tex-text">\((\dot{x}, \dot{v})=(0,0)\)</span> when <span class="tex-text">\((x, v)=(0,0)\)</span>; hence the origin is a fixed point. But a phase point starting anywhere else would circulate around the origin and eventually return to its starting point. Such trajectories form closed orbits, as shown in Figure 5.1.3. Figure <span class="tex-text">\(5.1 .3\)</span> is called the phase portrait of the system &#8211; it shows the overall picture of trajectories in phase space.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What do fixed points and closed orbits have to do with the original problem of a mass on a spring? The answers are beautifully simple. The fixed point <span class="tex-text">\((x, v)=(0,0)\)</span> corresponds to static equilibrium of the system: the mass is at rest at its equilibrium position and will remain there forever, since the spring is relaxed. The closed orbits have a more interesting interpretation: they correspond to periodic motions, i.e., oscillations of the mass. To see this, just look at some points on a closed orbit (Figure 5.1.4). When the displacement <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> is most negative, the velocity <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span> is zero; this corresponds to one extreme of the oscillation, where the spring is most compressed (Figure 5.1.4).</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the next instant as the phase point flows along the orbit, it is carried to points where <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> has increased and <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span> is now positive; the mass is being pushed back toward its equilibrium position. But by the time the mass has reached <span class="tex-text">\(x=0\)</span>, it has a large positive velocity (Figure 5.1.4b) and so it overshoots <span class="tex-text">\(x=0\)</span>. The mass eventually comes to rest at the other end of its swing, where <span class="tex-text">\(x\)</span> is most positive and <span class="tex-text">\(v\)</span> is zero again (Figure 5.1.4c). Then the mass gets pulled up again and eventually completes the cycle (Figure 5.1.4d).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The shape of the closed orbits also has an interesting physical interpretation. The orbits in Figures 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 are actually ellipses given by the equation <span class="tex-text">\(\omega^{2} x^{2}+v^{2}=C\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(C \geq 0\)</span> is a constant. In , you are asked to derive this geometric result, and to show that it is equivalent to conservation of energy.</p>
