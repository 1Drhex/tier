            <p class="blog"><strong>A Grand Entrance</strong></p> <p class="blog">You are designing an apparatus to support an actor of mass 65.0 kg who is to “fly” down to the stage during the performance of a play. You attach the actor’s harness to a 130-kg sandbag by means of a lightweight steel cable running smoothly over two frictionless pulleys as in Figure 8.5a. You need 3.00 m of cable between the harness and the nearest pulley so that the pulley can be hidden behind a curtain. For the apparatus to work successfully, the sandbag must never lift above the floor as the actor swings from above the stage to the floor. Let us call the initial angle that the actor’s cable makes with the vertical θ. What is the maximum value θ can have before the sandbag lifts off the floor?</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/التقاط-89.png"></div>

<strong>Conceptualize</strong> We must use several concepts to solve this problem. Imagine what happens as the actor approaches the bottom of the swing. At the bottom, the cable is vertical and must support his weight as well as provide centripetal acceleration of his body in the upward direction. At this point in his swing, the tension in the cable is the highest and the sandbag is most likely to lift off the floor.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Categorize</strong> Looking first at the swinging of the actor from the initial point to the lowest point, we model the actor and the Earth as an isolated system. We ignore air resistance, so there are no nonconservative forces acting. You might initially be tempted to model the system as nonisolated because of the interaction of the system with the cable, which is in the environment. The force applied to the actor by the cable, however, is always perpendicular to each element of the displacement of the actor and hence does no work. Therefore, in terms of energy transfers across the boundary, the system is isolated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Analyze </strong> We first find the actor’s speed as he arrives at the floor as a function of the initial angle θ and the radius R of the circular path through which he swings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the isolated system model, make the appropriate reduction of Equation 8.2 for the actor–Earth system:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta K+\Delta U+\Delta E_{\mathrm{int}}=W+Q+T_{\mathrm{MW}}+T_{\mathrm{MT}}+T_{\mathrm{ET}}+T_{\mathrm{ER}}\)</span> (8.2)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta K+\Delta U_{g}=0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Let <span class="tex-text">\(y_{i}\)</span> be the initial height of the actor above the floor and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{f}\)</span> be his speed at the instant before he lands. (Notice that <span class="tex-text">\(K_{i}=0\)</span> because the actor starts from rest and that <span class="tex-text">\(U_{f}=0\)</span> because we define the configuration of the actor at the floor as having a gravitational potential energy of zero.)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\text { (1) }\left(\frac{1}{2} m_{\text {actor }}{ v_{f}}^{2}-0\right)+\left(0-m_{\text {actor }} g y_{i}\right)=0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
From the geometry in Figure <span class="tex-text">\(8.5 \mathrm{a}\)</span>, notice that <span class="tex-text">\(y_{f}=0\)</span>, so <span class="tex-text">\(y_{i}=R-R \cos \theta=R(1-\cos \theta) .\)</span> Use this relationship in Equation (1) and solve for <span class="tex-text">\({v_{f}}^{2}\)</span> :</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\text { (2) } {v_{f}}^{2}=2 g R(1-\cos \theta)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Categorize </strong> Next, focus on the instant the actor is at the lowest point. Because the tension in the cable is transferred as a force applied to the sandbag, we model the actor at this instant as a particle under a net force. Because the actor moves along a circular arc, he experiences at the bottom of the swing a centripetal acceleration of <span class="tex-text">\({v_{f}}^{2} / r\)</span> directed upward.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Analyze</strong> Apply Newton’s second law from the particle under a net force model to the actor at the bottom of his path, using the free-body diagram in Figure 8.5b as a guide, and recognizing the acceleration as centripetal:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\sum F_{y}=T-m_{\text {actor }} g=m_{\text {actor }} \frac{{v_{f}}^{2}}{R}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\text { (3) } T=m_{\text {actor }} g+m_{\text {actor }} \frac{{v_{f}}^{2}}{R}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Categorize</strong> Finally, notice that the sandbag lifts off the floor when the upward force exerted on it by the cable exceeds the gravitational force acting on it; the normal force from the floor is zero when that happens. We do not, however, want the sandbag to lift off the floor. The sandbag must remain at rest, so we model it as a particle in equilibrium.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Analyze</strong> A force <span class="tex-text">\(T\)</span> of the magnitude given by Equation (3) is transmitted by the cable to the sandbag. If the sandbag remains at rest but is just ready to be lifted off the floor if any more force were applied by the cable, the normal force on it becomes zero and the particle in equilibrium model tells us that <span class="tex-text">\(T=m_{\text {bag }} g\)</span> as in Figure <span class="tex-text">\(8.5 \mathrm{c}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substitute this condition and Equation (2) into Equation (3):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(m_{\text {bag }} g=m_{\text {actor }} g+m_{\text {actor }} \frac{2 g R(1-\cos \theta)}{R}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solve for cos θ and substitute the given parameters:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}\cos \theta &amp;=\frac{3 m_{\text {actor }}-m_{\text {bag }}}{2 m_{\text {actor }}}=\frac{3(65.0 \mathrm{~kg})-130 \mathrm{~kg}}{2(65.0 \mathrm{~kg})}=0.500 \\\theta &amp;=60.0^{\circ}\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Finalize</strong> Here we had to combine several analysis models from different areas of our study. Notice that the length <span class="tex-text">\(R\)</span> of the cable from the actor&#8217;s harness to the leftmost pulley did not appear in the final algebraic equation for <span class="tex-text">\(\cos \theta\)</span>. Therefore, the final answer is independent of <span class="tex-text">\(R\)</span>.</p>
