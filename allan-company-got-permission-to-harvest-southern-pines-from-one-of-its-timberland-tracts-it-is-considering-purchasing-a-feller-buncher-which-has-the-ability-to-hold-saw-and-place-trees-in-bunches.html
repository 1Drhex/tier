            <p style="text-align: left;">Allan Company got permission to harvest southern pines from one of its timberland tracts. It is considering purchasing a feller-buncher, which has the ability to hold, saw, and place trees in bunches to be skidded to the log landing. The logging operation on this timberland tract must be completed in three years. Allan could speed up the logging operation, but doing so is not desirable because the market demand of the timber does not warrant such haste. Because the logging operation is to be done in wet conditions, this task requires a specially made feller-buncher with high-flotation tires and other devices designed to reduce site impact. There are two possible models of feller-buncher that Allan could purchase for this job: Model A is a two-year old used piece of equipment whereas Model B is a brand-new machine.<br /> • Model A costs $205,000 and has a life of 10,000 hours before it will require any major overhaul. The operating cost will run $50,000 per year for 2,000 hours of operation. At this operational rate, the unit will be operable for five years, and at the end of that time, it is estimated that the salvage value will be $75,000.<br /> • The more efficient Model B costs $275,000, has a life of 14,000 hours before requiring any major overhaul and costs $32,500 to operate for 2,000 hours per year in order to complete the job within three years. The estimated salvage value of Model B at the end of seven years is $95,000.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Since the lifetime of either model exceeds the required service period of three years, Allan Company has to assume some things about the used equipment at the end of that time. Therefore, the engineers at Allan estimate that, after three years, the Model A unit could be sold for $130,000 and the Model B unit for $180,000. After considering all tax effects, Allan summarized the resulting cash flows (in thousands of dollars) for the projects as follows:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  class=" aligncenter" width="332"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="64">Period</td> <td colspan="2" width="140">Model A</td> <td colspan="2" width="128">Model B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0</td> <td></td> <td> &#8211; $205000</td> <td></td> <td>&#8211; $ 275000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td></td> <td>-50,000</td> <td></td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td></td> <td>-50,000</td> <td></td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>130,000</td> <td>-50,000</td> <td>180,000</td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td></td> <td>-50,000</td> <td></td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>75,000</td> <td>-50,000</td> <td></td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>95000</td> <td>-32,500</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> First, note that these projects are service projects, so we can assume the same revenues for both configurations. Since the firm explicitly estimated the market values of the assets at the end of the analysis period (three years), we can compare the two models directly. Since<br /> the benefi ts (timber harvesting) are equal, we can concentrate on the costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Concentrate the costs:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{A}\)</span> = -$205,000 &#8211; $50,000(P/A, 15%, 3) + $130,000(P/F, 15%, 3)<br /> = -$233,684;<br /> PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{B}\)</span> = -$275,000 &#8211; $32,500(P/A, 15%, 3) + $180,000(P/F, 15%, 3)<br /> = -$230,852.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Model B is cheaper to operate and thus would be preferred. (See Figure 5.12 .)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> The decision heavily depends on the salvage value estimates at the end of the analysis period. Commonly, information about the salvage value of used equipment can be obtained from the equipment vendors because they are familiar with the secondary market for their equipment.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>METHODOLOGY </strong><br /> Construct a chart comparing the options, and compute the NPW for each model over the analysis period (three years).</p>
