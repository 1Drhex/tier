It is easy to create a time series graph in Excel. Here are the steps:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Select one or more columns with time series data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Optionally, select a column with dates if there is one. These dates are used to label the horizontal axis.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Select one of the line chart types, such as the line chart with markers, from the Insert ribbon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This procedure will usually get you nearly what you want, and then you can modify the chart to suit your needs, such as adding a title.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Date variable</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
When you proceed as above, the date variable is sometimes treated as another time series variable, with a line of its own. The happens, for example, in the crime data set with the Year variable. It looks numeric, so Excel treats it as another time series variable. In this case, select the chart, click Select Data on the Chart Tools Design ribbon, delete the date series in the left pane, and edit the right pane, selecting the date variable range for the horizontal axis.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Secondary axis</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
If you select two time series variables with very different magnitudes, the smaller will get swamped by the larger in the time series graph. In this case, right-click the smaller series, select Format Data Series, and check Secondary Axis. This allows you to see the smaller series on a separate scale.</p>
 <p class="blog">
These steps were used to create the time series graphs in Figures 2.17, 2.18, and 2.19. The graph in Figure 2.17 shows that violent and property crimes both increased sharply until the early 1990s and have gradually decreased since then. However, the time series population series in Figure 2.18 indicates that the U.S. population has increased steadily since 1960, so it is possible that the trend in crime rates is different than the trends in Figure 2.17. This is indeed true, as seen in Figure 2.19. It shows the good news that the crime rate has been falling since its peak in the early 1990s.<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The whole purpose of time series graphs is to detect historical patterns in the data. In this crime example, you are looking for broad trends.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 Why did this occur? One compelling reason was suggested by Levitt and Dubner in their popular book Freakonomics. You can read their somewhat controversial analysis to see if you agree.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We also created two more time series graphs that appear in Figures 2.20 and 2.21. The first shows the crime rates for the various types of violent crimes, and the second does the same for property crimes. The patterns (up, then down) are similar for each type of crime, but they are certainly not identical. For example, the larceny theft and motor vehicle theft rates both peaked in the early 1990s, but the burglary rate was well in decline by this time. Finally, Figure 2.20 indicates one problem with having multiple time series variables on a single graph—any variable with small values can be dominated by variables with much larger values. It might be a good idea to create two separate graphs for these four variables, with murder and rape on one and robbery and aggravated assault on the other. Then you could see the murder and rape patterns more clearly, and each of the graphs would be less cluttered.</p>
