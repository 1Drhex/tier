Although the moving averages method is quite easy to implement in Excel—you just form an average of the appropriate span and copy it down—it can be tedious. It is much easier to implement with StatTools. The StatTools forecasting procedure is fairly general in that it allows you to forecast with several methods, either with or without taking seasonality into account. Because this is your first exposure to this procedure, we will go through it in some detail in this example.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To use the StatTools Forecasting procedure, select Forecast from the StatTools Time Series and Forecasting dropdown list. This brings up a dialog box with three tabs in its bottom section. The Time Scale tab, shown in Figure 12.26, allows you to select the time period. The Forecast Settings tab, shown in Figure 12.27, allows you to select a forecasting method. Finally, the Graphs to Display tab, not shown here, allows you to select several optional time series graphs. For now, fill out the dialog box sections as shown and select the Forecast Overlay option in the Graphs to Display tab. Note from Figure 12.27 that the moving averages method is being used with a span of 3, and it will generate forecasts for the next 12 months.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another option in Figure 12.27 (not used here) is that you can elect to “hold out” a subset of the series for validation purposes. If you hold out several periods at the end of the series for validation, any model that is built is estimated only for the non-holdout observations, and summary measures are reported for the non-holdout and holdout subsets separately.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The output consists of several parts, as shown in Figures 12.28, 12.29, and 12.30. We actually ran the analysis twice, once for a span of 3 and once for a span of 12. These figures show the comparison. (We also obtained output for a span of 6, with results fairly similar to those for a span of 3.) First, the summary measures MAE, RMSE, and MAPE of the forecast errors are shown in Figure 12.28. As you can see, the forecasts using a span of 3 are slightly more accurate. For example, they are off by about 5.81% on average, whereas the similar measure with a span of 12 is 6.89%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The essence of the forecasting method is captured in column C of Figure 12.29 for a span of 3 (with many hidden rows). Each value in the historical period in this column is an average of the three preceding values in column B. The forecast errors are then just the differences between columns B and C. For the future periods, the forecast formulas in column C use observations when they are available. If they are not available, previous forecasts are used. For example, the forecast for April 2018 is the average of the observed values in January and February 2018 and the forecast value in March 2018.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The graphs in Figure 12.30 show the behavior of the forecasts. The forecast series with span 3 (the graph on the left) follows the ups and downs of the actual series fairly closely. In contrast, the 12-month moving average series is much smoother.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One interesting feature of the moving average method is that future forecasts tend to be quite flat. This is apparent in Figure 12.30. This is a basic property of moving average forecasts: future forecasts tend to be close to the last few values of the series.</p>
