The variables and constraints required to model this problem appear in Figure 4.32. (See the file Drug Production Big Picture.xlsx.) The key to the model is understanding which variables can be chosen—the decision variables—and which variables are determined by this choice. It is probably clear that Repco must decide how much of each drug to produce. However, it might not be clear why the amounts used for production of other drugs and the amounts sold are not decision variables. The idea is that as soon as Repco decides to produce, say, 10 units of drug B, it automatically knows that it must produce at least 20 units of drug A. In fact, it cannot decide to produce just any quantities of the three drugs. For example, it can’t produce 10 units of drug B and only 15 units of drug A. Therefore, the drugs required for producing other drugs put automatic constraints on the production quantities. Note that any drugs not used in production of other drugs are sold.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The key to the spreadsheet model is that everything produced is used in some way. Either it is used as an input to the production of some other drug, or it is sold. Therefore, the following balance equation holds for each product:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Amount produced = Amount used to produce other drugs +Amount sold (4.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This balance equation can be implemented in three steps:<br /> 1) Specify the amounts produced in decision variable cells.<br /> 2) Calculate the amounts used to produce other drugs based on the way the production process works.<br /> 3) Calculate the amounts sold from Equation (4.4) by subtraction. Then impose a constraint that Equation (4.4) must be satisfied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for Repco appears in Figure 4.33. (See the file Drug Production Finished.xlsx.) To proceed, perform the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs and range names. Enter the inputs in the light blue ranges. For example, the 2 in cell C7 indicates that two units of drug A are needed to produce each unit of drug B, and the 0’s in this range indicate which drugs are not needed to produce other drugs. (Note, however, the 0 in cell D7, which could be misleading. Drug A is required to make drug B, and drug B is required to make drug C. Therefore, drug A is required indirectly to make drug C. However, this indirect effect is accounted for by the values in cells C7 and D8, so the 0 in cell D7 is appropriate.) Then create the range names indicated.<br /> 2) Units produced. Enter any trial values for the number of units produced in the Units_produced range. This range contains the only decision variable cells.<br /> 3) Units used to make other products. In the range G16:I18, calculate the total number of units of each product that are used to produce other products. Begin by calculating the amount of A used to produce A in cell G16 with the formula<br /> =B7*B$16<br /> and copy this formula to the range G16:I18 for the other combinations of products. For example, in the solution shown, 10 units of drug B are produced, so 2000 units of drug A are required, as calculated in cell H16. Then calculate the row totals in column J with the SUM function. Then it is convenient (so that copyable formulas can be used in step 4 and the SUMPRODUCT function can be used in step 6) to transfer these sums in column J to the B18:D18 range. There are two ways to do this, that is, to make a column into a row or vice versa. The easiest way is to copy the range J16:J18, then select cell B18, select the Edit/Paste Special menu item, and check the Transpose option. Unfortunately, this method doesn’t copy formulas correctly. The better way uses Excel’s TRANSPOSE function. To copy the formulas correctly, select the B18:D18 range, type the formula<br /> =TRANSPOSE(J16:J18)<br /> and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter (all three keys at once).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: Paste Special Transpose<br /> To copy a row range to a column range, copy the row range, select the first cell in the column range, and select Transpose from the Paste dropdown menu on the Home ribbon. The same method can be used to copy a column range to a row range. However, this method doesn’t copy formulas correctly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: TRANSPOSE and Other Array Functions<br /> The TRANSPOSE function is useful for linking a row to a column or vice versa. It has the syntax TRANSPOSE(range). To implement it, select the row or column range where the results will go, type the formula, and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This function is one of several array functions in Excel, which means that it fills an entire range, not just a single cell, all at once. All array formulas require you to select the entire range where the results will go, type the formula, and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. After you do this, you will notice curly brackets around the formula in the Formula Bar. You should not actually type these curly brackets. They simply indicate that this is an array function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Units sold. Referring to Equation (4.4), determine the units sold of each drug by subtraction. Specifically, enter the formula<br /> =B16-B18<br /> in cell B19 and copy it to the range C19:D19.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Labor hours used. Calculate the total number of labor hours used in cell B23 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B5:D5,Units_produced)<br /> 6) Total revenue. Calculate Repco’s revenue from sales in cell B25 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B12:D12,Units_sold)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> To use Solver to maximize Repco’s revenue, fill in the Solver dialog box as shown in Figure 4.34. As usual, check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method before<br /> optimizing. Note that the drugs produced are constrained to be greater than or equal to the drugs used in production of other drugs. An equivalent alternative is to constrain the<br /> units sold to be nonnegative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution in Figure 4.33 indicates that Repco obtains a revenue of $70,000 by producing 2000 units of drug A, all of which are used to produce 1000 units of drug B. All units of drug B produced are sold. Even though drug C has the highest selling price, Repco produces none of drug C, evidently because of the large labor requirement for drug C.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> Drug C is not produced at all, even though its selling price is by far the highest. How high would this selling price have to be to induce Repco to produce drug C? You can use SolverTable to answer this, using drug C selling price as the input variable, letting it vary from $100 to $200 in increments of $10, and keeping track of the total revenue, the units produced of each drug, and the units used (row 18) of each drug. The results are shown in Figure 4.35.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As you can see, until the drug C selling price reaches $130, Repco uses the same solution as before<span class="tex-text">\(.^{7}\)</span> However, when it increases to $130 and beyond, 571.4 units of drug C are produced. This in turn requires 571.4 units of drug B, which requires 1142.9 units of drug A, but only drug C is actually sold. Of course, Repco would like to produce even more of drug C (which would require more production of drugs A and B), but the labor hour constraint does not allow it. Therefore, further increases in the selling price of drug C have no effect on the solution—other than increasing revenue.<br /> Because available labor imposes an upper limit on the production of drug C even when it is very profitable, it is interesting to see what happens when the selling price of drug C and the labor hours available both increase. Here you can use a two-way SolverTable, selecting selling price of drug C and labor hour availability as the two inputs with reasonable values, and selecting the amount produced of drug C as the single output. The results from SolverTable appear in Figure 4.36. (Each value is rounded to the nearest integer.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This table again shows that no drug C is produced, regardless of labor hour availability, until the selling price of drug C reaches $130. (The actual breakpoint is probably between $120 and $130. You can’t tell from the grid of input values used in the table.) The effect of increases in labor hour availability is to let Repco produce more of drug C. Specifically, Repco produces as much of drug C as possible, given that one unit of drug B, and hence two units of drug A, are required for each unit of drug C.<br /> Before leaving this example, we provide further insight into the sensitivity behavior in Figure 4.35. Specifically, why should Repco start producing drug C when its unit selling price increases to some value between $120 and $130? There is a straightforward answer to this question because the model contains a single resource constraint: the labor hour constraint. The analysis would be considerably more complicated with multiple resources.<br /> Consider the production of one unit of drug B, which requires two labor hours plus two units of drug A, each of which requires one labor hour, for a total of four labor hours. It returns $70 in revenue. Therefore, revenue per labor hour when producing drug B is $17.50. To be eligible as a “winner,” drug C has to beat this. Note that each unit of drug C requires seven labor hours (three for itself and four for the unit of drug B it requires). To beat the $17.50 revenue per labor hour of drug B, the unit selling price of drug C must be at least $122.50 [=17.50(7)]. If its selling price is below this, for example, $121, Repco will sell all drug B and no drug C. If its selling price is above this, for example, $127, Repco will sell all drug C and no drug B.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
7:If you ask for Solver’s sensitivity report, you will see that the change actually occurs when the price of drug C reaches $122.50. Our SolverTable grid of prices is too coarse to detect this exact changeover point.</p>
