            <p class="blog">The barn and ladder paradox. Unlike time dilation, there is no direct experimental confirmation of Lorentz contraction, simply because it’s too difficult to get an object of measurable size going anywhere near the speed of light. The following parable illustrates how bizarre the world would be if the speed of light were more accessible.</p> <p class="blog">There once was a farmer who had a ladder too long to store in his barn (Fig. 12.13a). He chanced one day to read some relativity, and a solution to his problem suggested itself. He instructed his daughter to run with the ladder as fast as she could—the moving ladder having Lorentz-contracted to a size the barn could easily accommodate, she was to rush through the door, whereupon the farmer would slam it behind her, capturing the ladder inside (Fig. 12.13b). The daughter, however, has read somewhat farther in the relativity book; she points out that in her reference frame the barn, not the ladder, will contract, and the fit will be even worse than it was with the two at rest (Fig. 12.13c). Question:Who’s right? Will the ladder fit inside the barn, or won’t it?</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/08/12.13.jpg"></div>

They’re both right! When you say “the ladder is in the barn,” you mean that all parts of it are inside at one instant of time, but in view of the relativity of simultaneity, that’s a condition that depends on the observer. There are really two relevant events here:<br /> a. Back end of ladder makes it in the door.<br /> b. Front end of ladder hits far wall of barn.<br /> The farmer says a occurs before b, so there is a time when the ladder is entirely within the barn; his daughter says b precedes a, so there is not. Contradiction? Nope—just a difference in perspective.<br /> “But come now,” I hear you protest, “when it’s all over and the dust clears, either the ladder is inside the barn, or it isn’t. There can be no dispute about that.”Quite so, but now you’re introducing a new element into the story: What happens as the ladder is brought to a stop? Suppose the farmer grabs the last rung of the ladder firmly with one hand, while he slams the door with the other. Assuming it remains intact, the ladder must now stretch out to its rest length. Evidently, the front end keeps going, even after the rear end has stopped! Expanding like an accordian, the front end of the ladder smashes into the far side of the barn. In truth, the whole notion of a “rigid” object loses its meaning in relativity, for when it changes its speed, different parts do not in general accelerate simultaneously— in this way, the material stretches or shrinks to reach the length appropriate to its new velocity.<span class="tex-text">\(^7\)</span><br /> But to return to the question at hand: When the ladder finally comes to a stop, is it inside the barn or not? The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of the ladder hits the far side of the barn, something has to give, and the farmer is left either with a broken ladder inside the barn or with the ladder intact poking through a hole in the wall. In any event, he is unlikely to be pleased with the outcome.</p>
