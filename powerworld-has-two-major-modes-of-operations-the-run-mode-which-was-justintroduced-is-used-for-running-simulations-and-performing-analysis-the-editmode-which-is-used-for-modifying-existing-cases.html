When switching to the Edit Mode notice that the ribbon changes slightly, with several of the existing buttons and icons disabled and others enabled. Also, the oneline now has a superimposed grid to help with alignment (the grid can be customized using the Grid/Highlight Unlinked options category on the Oneline Display Options dialog). In the Edit Mode, first add a new bus to the system. This can be done graphically by first selecting the <strong>Draw </strong>tab, then clicking on the <strong>Network</strong> button and selecting <strong>Bus</strong>. Once this is done, move the mouse to the desired oneline location and click (note the <strong>Draw </strong>tab is only available in the Edit Mode). The Bus Options dialog then appears. This dialog is used to set the bus parameters. For now leave all the bus fields at their default values, except set Bus Name to “bus 3” and set the nominal voltage to 16.0; note that the number for this new bus was automatically set to the one greater than the highest bus number in the case. The oneline should look similar to Figure 1.7. You may wish to save your case now to avoid losing your changes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By default, when a new bus is inserted, a bus field is also inserted. Bus fields are used to show information about buses on the onelines. In this case the new field shows the bus name, although initially in rather small fonts. To change the field’s font size, click on the field to select it, and then select the <strong>Format </strong>button (on the Draw ribbon) to display the Format dialog. Click on the <strong>Font </strong>tab and change the font’s size to a larger value to make it easier to see. You can also change the size of the bus itself using the Format dialog, Display/Size tab. To see the bus voltage magnitude, add an additional bus field. On the Draw ribbon select <strong>Field, Bus Field, </strong>and then click near bus 3. This displays the Bus Field Options dialog. Make sure the bus number is set to 3, and that the “Type of Field” is Bus Voltage. Again, resize with the <strong>Format, Font</strong> dialog.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, insert some load at bus 3. This can be done graphically by selecting <strong>Network, Load</strong> and then clicking on bus 3. The Load Options dialog appears, allowing you to set the load parameters. Note that the load was automatically assigned to bus 3. Leave all the fields at their default values, except set the orientation to “Down,” and enter 10.0 in the Constant Power column MW Value field. As the name implies, a constant power load treats the load power as being independent of bus voltage; constant power load models are commonly used in power system analysis. By default, PowerWorld “anchors” each load symbol to its bus. This is a handy feature when changing a drawing, since when you drag the bus, the load and all associated fields move as well. Note that two fields showing the load’s real (MW) and reactive (Mvar) power were also auto-inserted with the load. Select the reactive field right now, and then choose one. Delete (located towards the right side of the Draw ribbon) to remove it. You should also resize the MW field using the <strong>Format,</strong> <strong>Font</strong> command.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now join the bus 3 load to the rest of the system. Do this by adding a line from bus 2 to bus 3. Select <strong>Network, Transmission Line </strong>and then click on bus 2. This begins the line drawing. During line drawing, PowerWorld adds a new line segment for each mouse click. After adding several segments place the cursor on bus 3 and double-click. The Transmission Line/Transformer Options dialog appears, allowing you to set the line’s parameters. Note that PowerWorld should have automatically set the “from” and “to” bus numbers based upon the starting and ending buses (buses 2 and 3). If these values have not been set automatically, then you probably did not click exactly on bus 2 or bus 3; manually enter the values. Next, set the line’s Series Resistance (R) field to 0.3, the Series Reactance (X) field to 0.6, and the MVA Limits Limit (A) field to 20 (the details of transformer<br /> and transmission line modeling is covered in Chapters 3 through 5). Select OK to close the dialog. Note that PowerWorld also auto-inserted two circuit breakers and a round “pie chart” symbol. The pie charts are used to show the percentage loading of the line. You can change the display size for these objects by rightclicking on them to display their option dialogs.</p>
