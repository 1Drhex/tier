It contains 2007–2009 sales data from the fictional Contoso Company in five related tables: Dates, Products, Product-Categories, ProductSubcategories, and Sales. For illustration, there are two other files, Geography.csv and Stores.xlsx. The Stores file contains data on the stores where Contoso sells its products, and the Geography file contains data (for mapping purposes) about the locations of the stores. These latter two files aren’t currently related to one another or to the Contoso data, but the files contain key fields that can be used to relate them. How can data from Contoso be imported into a Data Model in Excel?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To use Power Query to import the Contoso tables and the Stores and Geography files into a Data Model in Excel.</p>

The following steps can be used to obtain the results in the Contoso Import Finished.xlsx file. (We again warn you that these are based on Excel in Office 365 for Windows.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Open a new workbook in Excel. If the Developer tab isn’t visible, right-click any ribbon, select Customize the Ribbon, and check the Developer item in the right pane of the resulting dialog box. The Developer ribbon has useful tools for programmers, but it also provides an easy way to get to Excel’s add-ins lists.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Click COM Add-Ins on the Developer ribbon and check the Microsoft Power Pivot for Excel item. This creates a Power Pivot tab and associated ribbon. You will need Power Pivot to “see” the imported data in the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Power Pivot must be loaded to “see” the data in a Data Model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. On the Data ribbon, click Get Data, then From Database, and then From Microsoft Access Database. Maneuver to the Contoso.accdb file and click Import.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. This opens the Navigator window in Figure 4.6. Fill it in as shown, checking the Select multiple items option and checking all five tables. When any table is selected, you see a preview of its data in the right pane.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. From the Load dropdown list, select Load To. This opens the Import Data dialog box in Figure 4.7. Fill it out as shown, selecting Only Create Connection and checking the bottom Data Model option, and click OK.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. A Query &amp; Connections pane with five queries, one for each table, will open in Excel, but when the data have finished downloading, you won’t see any data. Read on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. Because you filled out the Import Data dialog box as shown in Figure 4.7, the data don’t appear in an Excel table or pivot table. Instead, they are stored in a Data Model. To see the Data Model, select Manage from the Power Pivot ribbon. This opens the Power Pivot window in Figure 4.8, where you can see the imported data. This looks like an Excel workbook, with a tab for each of the five tables, but it is quite different, as we will discuss shortly. Note the two buttons circled at the bottom right. These are toggles between data and diagram views. Figure 4.8 shows the data view.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8. Click the diagram button at the bottom right and then move/resize the tables appropriately to see the relationships diagram in Figure 4.9. Although these tables are related in the Access source file through primary and foreign keys, they aren’t automatically linked with the arrows shown in the figure.<span class="tex-text">\(^{5}\)</span> However, you can drag from the obvious key fields to create these arrows and hence relate the tables. For example, drag from DateKey in the Dates table to DateKey in the Sales table to relate these two tables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
9. Back in the Excel window, click From Text/CSV on the Data ribbon, maneuver to the Geography.csv file, click Load To, and again fill out the dialog box as in Figure 4.7. Then repeat with the Stores data. This time, select From File from the Get Data dropdown list, choose From Workbook, and maneuver to the Sales.xlsx file. Once again, fill out the dialog box as in Figure 4.7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5 We’re not sure why Power Pivot doesn’t “inherit” the relations from the Access file. It does for some Access databases but not for this one. In any case, it’s easy to create the relationships, as explained here.</p>
 <p class="blog">
10. Open diagram view in the Power Pivot window. You will see the new Geography and Stores tables, but they won’t be related to anything. To relate them, drag StoreKey in the Sales table to StoreKey in the Stores table, and then drag GeographyKey in the Stores table to GeographyKey in the Geography table. The final relationships diagram should look like Figure 4.10. (The exact placement of the tables in this diagram is irrelevant. We try to avoid overlapping arrows.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Relationships can be created directly by dragging in diagram view of the Power Pivot window.</p>

<strong>Data Model Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Date Table</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Most Data Models will include a separate Dates table, even if dates of transactions are already listed in another table. The purpose of a Dates table is to list all possible dates in many possible ways. For example, the Dates table for the date 6/19/2018 might list the year, 2018; the quarter, Q2; the month number, 6; the month name, June; the day of the week, Tuesday; whether it is a weekday, Yes; whether it is a holiday, No; and possibly others. The reason is that you’re looking ahead to pivot tables, where you might want to break down transactions in many types of date-related ways. By creating all these date fields right away, you save yourself a lot of work later.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You have just seen how a small subset of the Power Query tools can be used to import related data into an Excel Data Model, where they can then be analyzed with pivot tables. If you compare the size of the original blank Excel file with the size of the finished file, you will see that the size increased from about 8 KB to about 2.5 MB. Although you can’t see the data in any Excel worksheets, the data are stored with the workbook in the compressed Data Model format.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By the way, suppose you select the Table option in Figure 4.7 and you check the Data Model option. This inflates your Excel workbook for no good reason. Each of the five Contoso tables is imported into a separate worksheet, and the same Data Model is created as before. Therefore, the same data are being stored twice, once in worksheets and once in the Data Model. It’s best to store the data just once, and the Data Model is often the better choice. Also, as you will see shortly, it doesn’t make sense to select the Pivot Table (or Pivot Chart) option and check the Data Model option. If you eventually want pivot tables, you can create them directly from the Data Model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is no need to store data in worksheets if the data are already stored in a Data Model.</p>
