In this example, we consider similar circuits in contrasting situations. In some cases, the circuit changes abruptly at time t = 0. Consequently, the circuit is not at steady state and we seek a complete responseâ€”consisting of both a steady-state part and a transient part. In other cases, there is no abrupt change and so no transient part of the response. We seek only the steady-state response. In one case, the input provides the inductor voltage directly, and we can determine the response using the constitutive equation of the inductor.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 1:</strong> The circuit in Figure 10.11-6a will be at steady state until time t = 0. Because the input is constant before time t = 0, all of the element voltages and currents will be constant. At time t = 0, the input changes abruptly, disturbing the steady state. Eventually the disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All of the element voltages and currents will again be constant, but they will have different constant values because the input has changed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The three stages can be illustrated as shown in Figure 10.11-7. Figure 10.11-7a represents the circuit for t &lt; 0. The source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor acts like a short circuit. The inductor current is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} A\)</span> <p class="blog">
In particular, immediately before t = 0, i(0-) = 0.667 A. The current in an inductor is continuous, so<br /> i(0+) = i(0-) = 0.667 A</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-7b represents the circuit immediately after t = 0. The input is constant but the circuit is not at steady state, so the inductor does not act like a short circuit. The part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor has the form of a Thevenin equivalent circuit, so we recognize that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(R_t = 6 Î© and v_{oc} = 12 V\)</span> <p class="blog">
Consequently,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_{sc} = \frac{12}{6}= 2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The time constant of the circuit is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\tau = \frac{L}{R_t} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Finally,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = i_{sc} + (i(0+) &#8211; i_{sc})e^{-t/ \tau} = 2 + (0.667 &#8211; 2)e^{-3t} = 2 &#8211; 1.33e^{-3t} A\)</span> <p class="blog">
As t increases, the exponential part of i(t) gets smaller. When t = 5<span class="tex-text">\(\tau\)</span> = 1.667 s,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = 2 &#8211; 1.33e^{-3(1.667)} = 2 &#8211; 0.009 â‰ˆ 2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The exponential part of i(t) has become negligible, so we recognize that the circuit is again at steady state and that the new steady-state current is i(t) = 2 A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-7c represents the circuit after the disturbance has died out and the circuit has reached steady state, that is, when t &gt; 5<span class="tex-text">\(\tau\)</span>. The source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor acts like a short circuit. As expected, the inductor current is 2 A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 2:</strong> The circuit in Figure 10.11-6b does not contain a switch and the input does not change abruptly, so we expect the circuit to be at steady state. The input is sinusoidal at a frequency of 5 rad/s, so all of the element currents and voltages will be sinusoidal at a frequency of 5 rad/s. We can find the steady-state response by representing the circuit in the frequency domain, using impedances and phasors as shown in Figure 10.11-8.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Ohmâ€™s law gives</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I(\omega) = \frac{12 \angle 0^\circ}{6 + j10} = \frac{12 \angle 0^\circ}{11.66 \angle 59^\circ} = 1.03 \angle -59^\circ A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The corresponding current in the time domain is</p>
 <p class="blog">
i(t) = 1.03 cos (5t &#8211; 59Â°) A</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 3:</strong> The voltage source, resistor, and inductor in the circuit in Figure 10.11-6c are connected in parallel. The element voltage of the resistor and inductor are each equal to the voltage source voltage. The current in the resistor is given by Ohmâ€™s law to be</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_R(t) = \frac{12e^{-5t}}{6} = 2e^{-5t} A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The current in the inductor is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_L(t) = \frac{1}{L} \int^t_0 {v(\tau) d\tau} + i_L(0) = \frac{1}{2} \int^t_0 {12e^{-5\tau} d\tau} + i_L(0) = \frac{12}{2(-5)} (e^{-5t} &#8211; 1) + i_L(0) = -1.2e^{-5t} + 1.2 + i_L(0)\)</span> <p class="blog">
Finally, using KCL gives</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = i_R(t) + i_L(t) = 2e^{-5t} &#8211; 1.2e^{-5t} + 1.2 + i_L(0) = 0.8e^{-5t} + 1.2 + i_L(0)\)</span> <p class="blog">
Before time t = 0, the voltage of source voltage is zero. If the circuit is at steady state, <span class="tex-text">\(i_L(0) = 0\)</span>. Then</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = 0.8e^{-5t} + 1.2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 4:</strong> The circuit in Figure 10.11-6d will be at steady state until the switch opens at time t = 0. Because the source voltage is constant, all of the element voltages and currents will be constant. At time t = 0, the switch opens, disturbing the steady state. Eventually the disturbance dies out and the circuit is again at steady state. All of the element voltages and currents will be constant, but they will have different constant values because the circuit has changed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The three stages can be illustrated as shown in Figure 10.11-9. Figure 10.11-9a represents the circuit for t &lt; 0. The closed switch is represented as a short circuit. The source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor acts like a short circuit. The inductor current is</p>
 <p class="blog">
i(t) = 0 A</p>
 <p class="blog">
In particular, immediately before t = 0, i(0-) = 0 A. The current in an inductor is continuous, so</p>
 <p class="blog">
i(0+) = i(0-) = 0 A</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-9b represents the circuit immediately after t = 0. The input is constant but the circuit is not at steady state, so the inductor does not act like a short circuit. The part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor has the form of a Thevenin equivalent circuit, so we recognize that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(R_t = 6 Î© and v_{oc} = 12 V\)</span> <p class="blog">
Consequently,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_{sc} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The time constant of the circuit is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\tau = \frac{L}{R_t} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Finally,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = i_{sc} + (i(0+) &#8211; i_{sc})e^{-t/ \tau} = 2 + (0 &#8211; 2)e^{-3t} = 2 &#8211; 2e^{-3t} A\)</span> <p class="blog">
As t increases, the exponential part of i(t) gets smaller. When t = 5<span class="tex-text">\(\tau\)</span> = 1.667 s,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = 2 &#8211; 2e^{-3(1.667)} = 2 &#8211; 0.013 â‰ˆ 2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
The exponential part of i(t) has become negligible, so we recognize that the circuit is again at steady state and that the steady state current is i(t) = 2 A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-9c represents the circuit after the disturbance has died out and the circuit has reached steady state, that is, when t &gt; 5<span class="tex-text">\(\tau\)</span>. The source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, so the inductor acts like a short circuit. As expected, the inductor current is 2 A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 5:</strong> The circuit in Figure 10.11-6e does not contain a switch and the input does not change abruptly, so we expect the circuit to be at steady state. Because the source voltage is constant, all of the element voltages and currents will be constant. Because the source voltage is constant and the circuit is at steady state, the inductor acts like a short circuit. (Weâ€™ve encountered this circuit twice before in this example, after the disturbance died out in cases 2 and 4.) The current is given by</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = \frac{12}{6} = 2 A\)</span> <p class="blog">
<strong>Case 6:</strong> We expect that the circuit in Figure 10.11-6f will be at steady state before the switch opens. As before, opening the switch will change the circuit and disturb the steady state. Eventually, the disturbance will die out and the circuit will again be at steady state. We will see that the steady-state current is constant before the switch opens and sinusoidal after the switch opens.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-11a shows the circuit before the switch opens. Applying KVL gives</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(2i(t) + 2 \frac{d}{dt} i(t) = 0\)</span> <p class="blog">
Consequently, the inductor current is i(t) = 0 before the switch opens. The current in an inductor is continuous, so</p>
 <p class="blog">
i(0+) = i(0-) = 0 A</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 10.11-11b represents the circuit after the switch opens. We can determine the inductor current by adding the natural response to the forced response and then using the initial condition to evaluate the constant in the natural response.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, we find the natural response. The part of the circuit that is connected to the inductor has the form of the Thevenin equivalent circuit, so we recognize that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(R_t = 6 Î©\)</span> <p class="blog">
The time constant of the circuit is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\tau = \frac{L}{R_t} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\)</span> <p class="blog">
The natural response is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_n(t) = Ke^{-3t} A\)</span> <p class="blog">
We can use the steady-state response as the forced response. As in case 2, we obtain the steady-state response by representing the circuit in the frequency as shown in Figure 10.11-11c. As before, we find <span class="tex-text">\(I(\omega) = 1.03 \angle -59^\circ A\)</span>. The forced response is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i_f(t) = 1.03 \cos (5t &#8211; 59^\circ) A\)</span> <p class="blog">
Then, <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = i_n(t) + i_f(t) = Ke^{-3t} + 1.03 \cos (5t &#8211; 59^\circ) A.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
At t = 0,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i(0) = Ke^{-0} + 1.03 \cos (-59^\circ) = K + 0.53\)</span> <p class="blog">
so <span class="tex-text">\(i(t) = -0.53e^{-3t} + 1.03 \cos (5t &#8211; 59^\circ) A\)</span></p>
