The problem definition is shown in Figure 7.29 . The inlet is situated at a distance of 4 L upstream of the step, where L is the height of the step as shown in Figure 7.29 . The inlet section is twice as high as the step. The total length of the channel is taken to be equal to 40 times the height of the step. Apart from the inlet and exit, all the other boundaries are assumed to be solid walls, where no slip boundary conditions are assumed to prevail. At the inlet to the channel, a nearly parabolic velocity profile of <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> was assumed. The reason why a perfect parabolic velocity profile was not taken is that the experimental data was not available on a perfectly parabolic velocity profile. In order to compare the numerical results with the available experimental data, we imposed the experimental inlet velocity profile from Denham and Patrik (1974), which was not perfectly parabolic. The <span class="tex-text">\( u_{2}\)</span> velocity at the inlet was assumed to be equal to zero at all times. The exit of the problem was situated at a distance of 36 times the step height in order to make sure that the disturbance created by the recirculation in the vicinity of the step was stabilized by the time flow reached the exit. At the exit, the pressure was prescribed as being equal to zero.The Reynolds number, based on the average inlet velocity and step height, was taken to be equal to 229 in order to compare the velocity profiles with the available experimental velocity profile. The flow was assumed to be laminar and the computation was started with an initial value of <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> equal to unity and <span class="tex-text">\( u_{2}\)</span> equal to zero. In addition to the velocity values, an initial pressure value of zero was assumed on all nodal points. The unstructured mesh employed in the calculation is shown in Figure 7.30 . In Figure 7.31 the results are shown, which are produced by the CBS scheme in its fully explicitform (artificial compressibility form). Here, the use of local time-stepping techniques accelerated the solution towards the steady-state as compared to a fixed global time step (Malan et al. 2002 a, b; Nithiarasu 2003). The u <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> velocity contours and pressure contours generated are given in Figures 7.31(a) and (b) . In Figure 7.31(c) the velocity profiles generated at different sections of the geometry, are compared with the experimental data of Denham et al. (Denham and Patrik 1974).The <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1} \)</span> velocity contours Figures 7.31(a) is marked with the recirculation pattern downstream of the step. This was the expected pattern in a problem of this nature. The pressure contours are marked with minor oscillations, which was due to relatively coarse unstructured mesh used.</p>
