            <p class="blog">It can be difficult to determine precisely when a profit has been earned. Even a simple manufacturing process can create the following events, any of which might be deemed to be the critical event:<br /> (i) customer places an order for goods which have not yet been manufactured,*<br /> (ii) raw materials acquired to fill order,*<br /> (iii) goods produced,*<br /> (iv) goods delivered,<br /> (v) customer pays,<br /> (vi) customer makes use of agreed after-sales service or warranties.<br /> (* If the customer places an order for goods that have already been manufactured then these steps will occur in the order (ii), (iii) then (i).</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Explain which of the events (i) to (vi) listed above is the most sensible point at which to recognise a profit according to IAS 18 Revenue.<br /> (b) Publisher is an entity that publishes a range of popular fiction. The entity has recently launched a new novel written by one of its established authors. Publisher has entered into the following contracts:<br /> (i) Bigseller books. This is a large chain of bookstores. Publisher has supplied Bigseller Books with a large number of copies of the new novel on a ‘sale or return basis’. This is a common arrangement in book publishing. From experience, Publisher expects approximately 20 per cent of the books to be returned for a full refund.<br /> (ii) Smallfry bookseller. This is a small independent bookshop. Publisher has supplied 20 copies of the new novel to Smallfry Bookseller. Publisher’s conditions are far less attractive for small customers and Smallfry cannot return any of the books unless it pays a substantial administration fee. Publisher rarely has any returns from small customers operating under these conditions.<br /> (iii) Newspro. Newspro publishes a leading Sunday newspaper. It has signed a contract which will allow it to publish three substantial extracts from the new novel in return for a fee of $800,000.<br /> You are required to explain how the principles for recognising income, as defined in IAS 18 Revenue, would apply to each of the cases (i) to (iii) above.</p>

(a) IAS 18 Revenue requires revenue from the sale of goods to be recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, provided that the amount of revenue can be estimated reliably and it is probable that payment will be received.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It would thus seem reasonable to recognise the revenue when the goods were despatched. That would normally be the point at which the entity would lose any real rights over the asset. It would also normally be the point at which the customer would be deemed to be committed to purchasing the goods.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Recognition at an earlier stage would be misleading because the entity could decide not to despatch the goods (e.g. if they were needed for another transaction or some doubts arose as to the customer’s credit rating). Recognition at a later stage would also be misleading because the entity becomes entitled to receive payment in full long before the customer actually pays.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the likelihood of the customer using any warranty or guarantee at a later date can be predicted and valued with any certainty then the entity might create a provision for such costs and these could be offset against the profit. If these costs cannot be predicted in any meaningful way then the entity would be better to recognise the profit as the selling price less the cost price and to recognise all warranty costs as and when they are incurred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) (i) Strictly, the entity should not recognise any profits from this arrangement until the books have been sold by Bigseller Books. It would, however, be acceptable to look at the underlying substance of this transaction and to treat the despatch of the books as a sale, but to create a provision for returns against any books in the customer’s hands as at the year end.<br /> (ii) This is the converse of the argument in (i) above. The customer is very unlikely to return any books and so it is realistic to treat the despatch as a sale.<br /> (iii) The newspaper appears to be committed to publishing the extracts and so there is nothing to stand in the way of Publisher receiving the $800,000. It would, therefore, be acceptable to treat this as a source of income.</p>
