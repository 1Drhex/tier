(a) There are many different kinds of users of financial statements, and each group may be interested in different aspects of an entity’s financial statements. The requirement that all entities produce an income statement and balance sheet in the prescribed format may mean that any one group of users receives less than the ideal set of information that it would like, but there are also several advantages for all readers. For accounts to be useful, they must be understandable. Information will be wasted if it cannot be understood by the readers for whom it is intended. If all entities present similar information in a similar form, the financial statements can be used by everyone who is prepared to learn the basics of accounting.<br /> The relevance and reliability of financial statements can be increased by ensuring that they are comparable. The quality of comparability includes the fundamental accounting concept of consistency, since the usefulness of accounting information is increased if it is prepared and presented on a consistent basis from one period to the next. The requirements of IAS 1 attempt to ensure that the accounts are consistent over the years. Consistency is important too for comparing financial information with corresponding<br /> information from some other entity. If entities were not required to present information using the same ‘template’, the interpretation of accounts using ratio analysis would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.<br /> (b) International accounting standards require that entities provide details of any guarantees and other financial commitments into which they may have entered. Specific items which must be disclosed include details of any charge on the assets of the entity; details of the amount and nature of any contingent liability not provided in the accounts; details of the amounts of capital expenditure authorised by the directors but not contracted for.<br /> This note is particularly useful to the readers of financial statements, since it discloses information that is otherwise ‘invisible’ to them. The presence of such items as contingent liabilities or third-party guarantees is not recorded by the double-entry accounting system. They therefore do not appear as part of either the income statement or the balance sheet. Commitments and contingencies can often form a significant part of the overall financial view of the entity and many financial analysts read this note to the accounts before any others.</p>
