            <p class="blog">STK sells bathroom fittings throughout Europe. In order to obtain the best price, it has decided to purchase all its annual demand of 10,000 shower units from a single supplier. After investigation, it has identified two possible manufacturers – SSS and RRR. Each has offered to provide the required number of showers each year under an exclusive long-term<br /> contract.</p> <p class="blog">Demand for shower units is at a constant rate all year. The cost to STK of holding one shower unit in inventory for one year is $4 plus 3% of the purchase price.<br /> SSS is located only a few miles from the STK main showroom. It has offered to supply each shower unit at $400 with a transport charge of $200 per delivery. It has guaranteed such a regular and prompt delivery service that STK believes it will not be necessary to hold any safety inventory (i.e. buffer inventory) if it uses SSS as its supplier.<br /> RRR is located in the Far East. It has offered to supply each shower unit at $398 but transport charges will be $500 per delivery. There is also a minimum order size of 1,000 shower units. Deliveries will be by ship and will therefore take some time to arrive. There is also significant uncertainty about the lead time which means that STK will need to hold a<br /> safety inventory of 600 shower units.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Using the EOQ model, calculate the optimal order size, assuming that SSS is chosen as the sole supplier of shower units for STK.<br /> (b) (i) Prepare calculations to determine whether SSS or RRR should be chosen as the sole supplier of shower units for STK.<br /> (ii) Describe any further factors that STK should consider before making a final choice of supplier.<br /> (c) Assume you are a consultant advising the Far East based entity RRR. Write a brief memorandum explaining how RRR could finance the necessary working capital for its proposed contract to supply STK.</p>

Examiner’s note<br /> It is necessary to check the EOQ to ascertain if the minimum delivery volume of 1,000 is a relevant (that is binding) constraint. In this case it is, thus an order quantity of 1,000 applies.</p>

 <p class="blog">
Further factors that need to be considered are:<br /> ● The uncertainty of supply from RRR may lead to additional costs from running out of inventory, despite the safety inventory.<br /> ● Exchange rate movements may mean that the cost may increase if the contract with RRR has been written in the overseas currency. Hedging may lead to additional costs. Given that the two options are very close in terms of overall costs this may make a difference to the decision.<br /> ● If deliveries are incorrect or faulty then re-supply may take a significant amount of time from RRR.<br /> ● The length of the lead time with RRR will require additional forward planning of inventory requirements.<br /> (c)<br /> Memorandum<br /> To: RRR From: A Consultant<br /> Subject: Financing STK contract Date: 19 November 2002</p>
 <p class="blog">
Financing needs<br /> In financing exports, there are a number of specific factors to be considered in addition to those present for domestic sales:<br /> ● The long lead time in delivering to STK by ship will mean additional working capital is tied up in inventory.<br /> ● International settlement may take longer as, for instance, it may be more difficult to put pressure on STK if it is slow in settling its debts.<br /> ● Foreign currency exchange may cause additional costs and/or risks depending on which of the two currencies forms the basis of the contract.<br /> ● Regulatory and compliance problems may cause additional delays in the transfer of goods or funds.<br /> ● There is an increased risk of bad debts where it is more difficult to obtain information due to geographic remoteness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Methods of export finance<br /> Examiner’s note<br /> Explanations by candidates do not require the level of detail supplied below in order to earn the required mark.<br /> Export factoring<br /> Debts may be sold to an export factor in much the same way as domestic factoring. This may include credit insurance to reduce bad debt risk.<br /> Bills of exchange<br /> A bill of exchange is an unconditional order by one person/entity to pay another a given sum at a specified future date. These are tradable, having a short date, normally within 180 days. They are, however, subject to default risk depending upon the creditworthiness of the drawee.<br /> Bills of exchange are commonly used in export finance and will mean they can be sold at a discount to obtain more immediate cash.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Documentary credits (letters of credit)<br /> This is a document issued by a bank on behalf of a customer authorising a person to draw money to a specified amount from its branches or correspondents, usually in another country, when the conditions set out in the document have been met.<br /> It thus provides a secure means of obtaining payment from an overseas sale. These are, however, time consuming and expensive for trade and are thus only normally used where there is a high risk of a bad debt.<br /> Forfeiting<br /> This is normally most appropriate to capital goods where payment is over a number of years, but may also apply to a long-term contract such as that with STK as a means of obtaining medium-term export finance.<br /> The buyer (STK ) must undertake to make regular payments. It issues a series of promissory notes maturing on a regular basis (for example every six months). The buyer must also find a bank to guarantee (avalise) the notes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
RRR must find a bank to act as forfeiter. RRR will then receive the notes when STK receives the goods. It can then sell them to the forfeiting bank, at a discount, but without recourse, for immediate payment.<br /> This reduces bad debt risk, reduces foreign exchange risk and provides immediate settlement – at a cost.<br /> Advanced payment<br /> As part of the contract, partial or full advanced payment might be arranged with STK (for example when the goods are in transit).</p>
