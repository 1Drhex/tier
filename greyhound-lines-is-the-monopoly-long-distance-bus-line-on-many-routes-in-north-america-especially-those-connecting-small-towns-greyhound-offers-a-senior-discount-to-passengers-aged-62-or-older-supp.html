            <p class="blog">Greyhound Lines is the monopoly long-distance bus line on many routes in North America, especially those connecting small towns. Greyhound offers a senior discount to passengers aged 62 or older.

If price discrimination by age is legal:<br /> 1. Determine the profit-maximizing price that the bus line sets for each age group by setting the relevant marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost. If the monopoly can price discriminate, it sets a monopoly price independently for each group. The revenue function for group 1 is <span class="tex-text">\(R_{1} = p_{1}Q_{1} = 60Q_{1} &#8211; 5Q_{1}^{2}\)</span> .Thus, the marginal revenue is <span class="tex-text">\(dR_{1}/dQ_{1} = MR^{1} = 60 &#8211; 10Q_{1}\)</span>. The marginal revenue curve is twice as steeply sloped as is the linear inverse demand curve (see Solved ), as panel a of the figure illustrates. The monopoly maximizes its profit where its marginal revenue function equals its marginal cost,<span class="tex-text">\(MR^{1} = 60 &#8211; 10Q_{1}= 10 = MC\)</span>. Solving, we find that its profit-maximizing output is <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}= 5\)</span>. Substituting this quantity into the inverse demand curve for group 1, we learn that the monopoly’s profit-maximizing price is<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(p_{1} = 60 &#8211; (5 ×5) = 35\)</span>, as panel a shows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Similarly, for group 2, the inverse demand curve is <span class="tex-text">\(p_{2} = 90 &#8211; 10Q_{2}\)</span>, so the monopoly chooses <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span> such that <span class="tex-text">\(MR^{1} = 90 &#8211; 20Q_{2} = 10 = MC\)</span>. Thus, it maximizes its profit for group 2 where <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} = 4 and p_{2} = 50\)</span> in panel b.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If price discrimination by age is not legal:<br /> 2. Derive the total demand curve. If Greyhound cannot price discriminate, it<br /> charges the same price, p, to all users. The company faces the total demand curve in panel c, which is the horizontal sum of the demand curves for each of the two age groups in panels a and b (Chapter 2). If the price is between 60 and 90, the quantity demanded is positive only for the adults, so the total demand curve (panel c) is just the adults’ demand curve (panel b). If the price is less than 60, then both groups demand a positive quantity, and the total demand curve in panel c is the horizontal sum of the two age groups’ demand curves (panels a and b)<span class="tex-text">\(.^{8}\)</span> As panel c shows, the total demand curve has a kink at p = 60, because<br /> the quantity demanded by seniors is positive at only lower prices.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Determine the marginal revenue curve corresponding to the total demand curve. Because the total demand curve has a kink at p = 60, the corresponding marginal revenue curve has two sections. At prices greater than 60, the marginal revenue curve is that of the adults, group 2. At prices less than 60,the inverse total demand function is p = 70 &#8211; (1/0.3)Q, so the revenue function is R = 70 &#8211; (1/0.3)Q2 and the marginal revenue function is dR/dQ = MR = 70 &#8211; (2/0.3)Q. Panel c shows that the marginal revenue curve jumps—is discontinuous—at the quantity where the total demand curve has a kink.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Solve for the single-price monopoly solution. Greyhound maximizes its profit<br /> where its marginal revenue equals its marginal cost. From inspecting panel c, we learn that the intersection occurs in the section where both age groups have positive demand, so that MR = 70 &#8211; (2/0.3)Q = 10 = MC. Solving this equation, we find that the profit-maximizing output is Q = 9. Substituting that quantity into the inverse total demand function, we learn that Greyhound charges p = 40. Thus, if it can set only a single price, Greyhound’s price,<br /> 40, lies between the two prices it would charge if it could price discriminate: 35 &lt;40 &lt;50.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
8Rearranging the inverse demand functions, we find that the seniors’ demand function is <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1} = 12 &#8211; 0.2p_{1}\)</span> and the adults’ demand function is <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2} = 90 &#8211; 0.1p_{2}\)</span>. As a result for a price less than 60, the total demand function is Q = (12 &#8211; 0.2p) + (9 &#8211; 0.1p) = 21 &#8211; 0.3p, where <span class="tex-text">\(Q = Q_{1} + Q_{2}\)</span> is the total quantity that the monopoly sells and p is the common price.</p>
