We pay $112,500 in tax as opposed to $120,000 because we have capital investment which has earned tax<br /> depreciation in the early years. The situation reverses in future years however when tax depreciation falls to $0 and accounting depreciation is still being charged to the income statement. Profits of $400,000 in 20X4 and a tax rate of 30%, would result in tax to pay of $120,000. However the taxable profits would be calculated as:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 315px" width="466"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="129"></td> <td width="87">20X0</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"></td> <td width="87">$000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129">Tax computation</td> <td width="87"></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129">Accounting profit</td> <td width="87">400</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129">Add back accounting depreciation charge</td> <td width="87">50</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129">Taxable profits</td> <td width="87">450</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129">Tax at 30%</td> <td width="87">135</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
The tax payable has increased from $120,000 to $135,000 due to the add back of accounting depreciation. The accounting treatment prudently requires that in the early years when tax depreciation exceeds accounting depreciation and the taxable profits are reduced, that we provide for the future increased taxable profits by creating a provision for deferred tax and releasing this provision to cover the increased tax charge when tax depreciation falls below the accounting depreciation charge.</p>
