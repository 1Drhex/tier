            <p class="blog">Ordering NCAA T-Shirts<br /> It is March, and the annual NCAA Basketball Tournament is down to the final four teams. Randy Kitchell is a T-shirt vendor who plans to order T-shirts with the names of the final four teams from a manufacturer and then sell them to the fans. The fixed cost of any order is $750, the variable cost per T-shirt to Randy is $8, and Randy’s selling price is $18. However, this price will be charged only until a week after the tournament. After that time, Randy figures that interest in the T-shirts will be low, so he plans to sell all remaining T‑shirts, if any, at $6 each. His best guess is that demand for the T-shirts during the fullprice period will be 1500. He is thinking about ordering 1450 T-shirts, but he wants to build a spreadsheet model that will let him experiment with the uncertain demand and his order quantity. How should he proceed?</p> <hr /> <p class="blog">Objective To build a spreadsheet model in a series of stages, with all stages being correct but each stage being more readable and flexible than the previous stages.</p>

The logic behind the model is fairly simple, but the model is built for generality. Specifically, the formulas allow for the order quantity to be less than, equal to, or greater than demand. If demand is greater than the order quantity, Randy will sell all the T-shirts ordered for $18 each. However, if demand is less than the order quantity, Randy will sell as many T-shirts as are demanded at the $18 price and all leftovers at the $6 price. You can implement this logic in Excel with an IF function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A first attempt at a spreadsheet model appears in Figure 2.1. (See the file TShirt Sales Finished.xlsx, where each stage appears on a separate worksheet<span class="tex-text">\(.^{1}\)</span>) You enter a possible demand in cell B3, a possible order quantity in cell B4, and then calculate the profit in cell B5 with the formula:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=-750-8*B4+IF(B3&gt;B4,18*B4,18×B3+6*(B4-B3))</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula subtracts the fixed and variable costs and then adds the revenue according to the logic just described.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Excel Function: IF<br /> Excel’s IF function is probably already familiar to you, but it is too important not to discuss. It has the syntax =IF(condition,result_if_True,result_if_False). The condition is any expression that is either true or false. The two expressions result_if_True and result_if_False can be any expressions you would enter in a cell: numbers, text, or other Excel functions (including other IF functions). Note that if either expression is text, it must be enclosed in double quotes, such as:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=IF(Score&gt;=90,&#8221;A&#8221;,&#8221;B&#8221;)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, condition can be complex combinations of conditions, using the keywords AND or OR. Then the syntax is, for example,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=IF(AND(Score1&lt;60,Score2&lt;60),&#8221;Fail&#8221;,&#8221;Pass&#8221;)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This model in Figure 2.1 is entirely correct, but it isn’t very readable or flexible because it breaks a rule that you should strive never to break: It hard codes input values into the profit formula. A spreadsheet model should never include input numbers in formulas. Instead, the spreadsheet model should store input values in separate cells and then include cell references to these inputs in its formulas. A remedy appears in Figure 2.2. Here, the inputs have been entered in the range B3:B6, and the profit formula in cell B10 has been changed to:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=-B3-B4*B9+IF(B8&gt;B9,B5*B9,B5*B8+B6*(B9-B8))</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Never hard code numbers into Excel formulas. Use cell references instead.</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
his is exactly the same formula as before, but it is now more flexible. If an input changes, the profit recalculates automatically. Most important, the inputs are no longer buried in the formula. Still, the profit formula is not very readable as it stands. You can make it more readable by using range names. The mechanics of range names are covered in detail later in this chapter. For now, the results of using range names for cells B3 through B6, B8, and B9 are shown in Figure 2.3. This model looks exactly like the previous model, but the formula in cell B10 is now</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=-Fixed_order_cost−Variable_cost*Order+IF(Demand&gt;Order,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Selling_price*Order,Selling_price*Demand+Discount_price*(Order-Demand))</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula is admittedly more long-winded, but it is certainly easier to read.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Randy might like to have profit broken down into various costs and revenues as shown in Figure 2.4, rather than one single profit cell. The formulas in cells B12, B13, B15, and B16 are straightforward, so they are not repeated here. You can then accumulate these to get profit in cell B17 with the formula</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">=-(B12+B13)+(B15+B16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Of course, range names could be used for these intermediate output cells, but this is probably more work than it’s worth. You should always use some judgment when deciding how many range names to use.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If Randy’s assistant is presented with this model, how does she know at a glance which cells contain inputs or decision variables or outputs? Labels and/or color coding can help to distinguish these types. A blue/red/gray color-coding style has been applied in Figure 2.5, along with descriptive labels in boldface. The blue cells at the top are input cells, the red cell in the middle is a decision variable, and the gray cell at the bottom is the key output<span class="tex-text">\(.^{2}\)</span> There is nothing sacred about this particular convention. Feel free to adopt your own convention and style, but be sure to use it consistently.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The model in Figure 2.5 is still not the last word on this example. As shown in later examples, you can create data tables to see how sensitive profit is to the inputs, the demand, and the order quantity. You can also create charts to show any numerical results graphically. But this is enough for now. You can see that the model in Figure 2.5 is now much more readable and flexible than the original model<br /> in Figure 2.1.</p>

Fundamental Insight<br /> Spreadsheet Layout and Documentation If you want your spreadsheets to be used (and you want your value in your company to rise), think carefully about your spreadsheet layout and then document your work. For layout, think about whether certain data are best oriented in rows or columns, whether your work is better placed in a single sheet or in multiple sheets, and so on. For documentation, use descriptive labels and headings, color coding, cell comments, and text boxes to make your spreadsheets more readable. It takes time and careful planning to design and then document your spreadsheet models, but the time is well spent. And if you come back in a few days to a spreadsheet model you developed and you can’t make sense of it, don’t be afraid to redesign your work completely—from the ground up.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
Because good spreadsheet style is so important, the appendix to this chapter discusses a few tools for editing and documenting your spreadsheet models.Use these tools right away and as you progress through the book.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the rest of this chapter, we discuss a number of interesting examples and introduce important modeling concepts (such as sensitivity analysis), important Excel features (such as data tables), and even some important business concepts (such as net present value). To get the most from these examples, follow along at your own computer, starting with a blank spreadsheet or the appropriate “example template” spreadsheet that accompanies the book. It is one thing to read about spreadsheet modeling; it is quite another to actually do it!</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
1:There are two versions (in separate folders) of all example files: an “example template” version and a “finished example” version. The latter shows the completed spreadsheet, along with helpful comments; the former shows just the labels and inputs, so that you can complete it according to the instructions in the book.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2:This color convention shows up clearly in the Excel files that accompany the book. However, in this two-color book (shades of gray and blue), it is difficult to see the color-coding scheme. We recommend that you look not only at the figures in the book but also at the actual Excel files.</p>
