            <p class="blog">Gary’s demand for doctor visits depends on his health. Half the time his health is good and his demand is <span class="tex-text">\(D^{1}\)</span> in the figure. When his health is poor, his demand is <span class="tex-text">\(D^{2}\)</span>. Gary is risk averse. Without medical insurance, he pays $50 a visit. With full insurance, he pays a fixed fee at the beginning of the year, and the insurance company pays the full cost of any visit. Alternatively, with a contingent contract, Gary pays a smaller premium at the beginning of the year, and the insurance company covers only $20 per visit, with Gary paying the remaining $30. How likely is a moral hazard problem to occur with each of these contracts? What is Gary’s risk (the variance of his medical costs) with no insurance and with each of the two types of insurance? Compare the contracts in terms of the trade-offs between risk and moral hazard.</p>

1. Describe the moral hazard for each demand curve for each contract. Given that Gary’s health is good, if he does not have insurance, Gary pays the doctor $50 a visit and goes to the doctor once, at point <span class="tex-text">\(a_{1}\)</span> on <span class="tex-text">\(D^{1}\)</span> in the figure. In contrast, with full insurance, where he pays nothing per visit, he visits the doctor six times, at <span class="tex-text">\(c_{1}\)</span>. Similarly, if his health is poor, he goes to the doctor five times, <span class="tex-text">\(a_{2}\)</span>, without insurance, and 10 times, <span class="tex-text">\(c_{2}\)</span>, with full insurance. Thus, regardless of his health, he makes five extra visits a year with full insurance. These extra visits are the moral hazard.</p>
 <p class="blog">
With a contingent contract, Gary pays $30 a visit. He makes three visits if his health is good (at point <span class="tex-text">\(b_{1}\)</span>)—only two more than at <span class="tex-text">\(a_{1}\)</span>. If his health is poor, he makes seven visits, once again two more than if he were paying the full fee (five visits at point <span class="tex-text">\(a_{2}\)</span>). Thus, this contingent contract reduces the moral hazard problem: He makes only two extra visits.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Calculate the variance of Gary’s medical expenses for no insurance and for the two insurance contracts. Without insurance, his average number of visits is <span class="tex-text">\(3 = (\frac {1}{2} ×1) + (\frac {1}{2} × 5\)</span>), so his average annual medical cost is $150. Thus, the variance of his medical expenses without insurance is:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(σ_{n}^{2} = \frac {1}{2}\)</span>[(1 × $50) &#8211; $150]<span class="tex-text">\(^{2} + \frac {1}{2}\)</span>[(5 × 50) &#8211; $150]<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= \frac {1}{2}\)</span>($50 &#8211; $150)<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span> +<span class="tex-text">\( \frac {1}{2}\)</span>($250 &#8211; $150)<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $10,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If he has full insurance, he makes a single fixed payment each year, so his payments do not vary with his health: His variance is <span class="tex-text">\(σ_{f}^{2}= 0\)</span>. Finally, with partial insurance, he averages 5 visits with an average cost of $150, so his variance is:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(σ_{p}^{2}= \frac {1}{2}\)</span>($90 &#8211; $150)<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span> + <span class="tex-text">\(\frac {1}{2}\)</span>($210 &#8211; $150)<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span> =$3,600.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, <span class="tex-text">\(σ_{n}^{2} &gt; σ_{p}^{2} &gt; σ_{f}^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Discuss the trade-offs. Because Gary is risk averse, efficiency in risk bearing requires the insurance company to bear all the risk, as with full insurance. However, full insurance results in the largest moral hazard. Removing insurance eliminates the moral hazard, but forces Gary to bear all the risk. The contingent contract is a compromise in which both the moral hazard and the degree of risk lie between the extremes.<br /> .</p>
