We purposely constructed this data set to have a number of problems, all of which you might encounter in real data sets. We begin with the Social Security Number (SSN). Presumably, all 1500 customers are distinct people, so all 1500 SSNs should be different. How can you tell if they are? One simple way is as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Sort on the SSN column.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Once the SSNs are sorted, enter the formula =If(B3=B2,1,0) in cell J3 and copy this formula down column J. This formula checks whether two adjacent SSNs are equal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Enter the formula =SUM(J3:J501) in cell J2 to see if there are any duplicate SSNs (see Figure 4.40). As you can see, there are two pairs of duplicate SSNs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. To find the duplicates, select the range from cell J3 down and select Find from the Find &amp; Select dropdown menu on the Home ribbon, with the resulting dialog box filled in as shown in Figure 4.41. In particular, make sure the bottom box has Values selected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Click the Find Next button twice to find the offenders. Customers 369 and 618 each have SSN 283-42-4994, and customers 159 and 464 each have SSN 680-00-1375.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At this point, the company should check the SSNs of these four customers, which are hopefully available from another source, and enter them correctly here. (You can then delete column J and sort on column A to bring the data set back to its original form.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Birthdate and Age columns present two interesting problems. When the birthdates were entered, they were entered in exactly the form shown (10/26/44, for example). Then the age was calculated by a somewhat complex formula, just as you would calculate your own age.<span class="tex-text">\(^{9}\)</span> Are there any problems? First, sort on Birthdate. You will see that the first 18 customers all have birthdate 05/17/27—quite a coincidence (see Figure 4.42). As you may know, Excel’s dates are stored internally as integers (the number of days since January 1, 1900), which you can see by formatting dates as numbers. So highlight these 18 birthdates and format them with the Number option (zero decimals) to see which number they correspond to. It turns out to be 9999, the code often used for a missing value. Therefore, it is likely that these 18 customers were not born on 05/17/27 after all. Their birthdates were probably missing and simply entered as 9999, which were then formatted as dates. If birthdate is important for further analysis, these 18 customers should probably be deleted from the data set or their birthdates should be changed to blanks if the true values cannot be found.</p>
 <p class="blog">
9 In case you are interested in some of Excel’s date functions, we left the formula for age in cell D2. (We replaced this formula by its values in the rest of column D; otherwise, Excel takes quite a while to recalculate it 1500 times.) This formula uses Excel’s TODAY, YEAR, MONTH, and DAY functions. Check online help to learn more about these functions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It gets even more interesting if you sort on the Age variable. You will see that the first 12 customers after sorting have negative ages (see Figure 4.43). You have just run into a Y2K (year 2000) problem. These 12 customers were all born before 1930. Excel guesses that any two-digit year from 00 to 29 corresponds to the 21st century, whereas those from 30 to 99 correspond to the 20th century.<span class="tex-text">\(^{10}\)</span> This guess was obviously a bad one for these 12 customers, and you should change their birthdates to the 20th century. An easy way to do this is to highlight these 12 birthdates, select Replace from the Find &amp; Select dropdown list, fill out the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 4.44, and click the Replace All button. This replaces any year that begins with 202, as in 2028, with a year that begins with 192. (Always be careful with the Replace All option. For example, if you enter /20 and /19 in the “Find what:” and “Replace with:” boxes, you will not only replace the years, but the 20th day of any month will also be replaced by the 19th day.) If you copy the formula for Age that was originally in cell D2 to all of column D, the ages should recalculate automatically as positive numbers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Region variable presents a problem that can be very hard to detect—because you usually are not looking for it. There are four regions: North, South, East, and West. If you sort on Region and scroll down, you will find a few East values, a few North values, a few South values, and a few West values, and then the East values start again. Why aren’t the East values all together? If you look closely, you will see that a few of the labels in these cells—those at the top after sorting—begin with a space. The person who entered them inadvertently entered a space before the name. Does this matter? It certainly can. Suppose<br /> you create a pivot table, for example, with Region in the Rows area. You will get eight row categories, not four. Therefore, you should delete the extra spaces. The most straightforward way is to use Replace from the Find &amp; Select dropdown menu in the obvious way. (Excel also has a handy TRIM function that removes any leading or trailing spaces from a label.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
A slightly different problem occurs in the Cred Card User column, where 1 corresponds to credit card users and 0 corresponds to nonusers. A typical use of these numbers might be to find the proportion of credit card users, which you can find by entering the formula =AVERAGE(F2:F1501) in some blank cell. This should give the proportion of 1’s, but instead it gives an error (#DIV/0!). What is wrong? A clue is that the numbers in column F are left-justified, whereas numbers in Excel are usually right-justified. Here is what might have happened. Data on credit card users and nonusers might initially have been entered as the labels Yes and No. Then to convert them to 1 and 0, someone might have entered the formula IF(F4=“Yes”,“1”,“0”). The double quotes around 1 and 0 cause them to be interpreted as text, not numbers, and no arithmetic can be done on them. (In addition, text is typically left-justified, the telltale sign seen here.) Fortunately, Excel has a VALUE function that converts text entries that look like numbers to numbers. So you should form a new column that uses this VALUE function on the entries in column F to convert them to numbers. (Specifically, you can create these VALUE formulas in a new column, then do a Copy and Paste Special as Values to replace the formulas by their values, and finally cut and paste these values over the original text in column F.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next consider the Income column. If you sort on it, you will see that most incomes are from $20,000 to $160,000. However, there are a few at the top that are much smaller, and there are a few 9999s (see Figure 4.45). By this time, you can guess that the 9999’s correspond to missing values, so unless these true values can be found, these customers should probably be deleted if Income is crucial to the analysis (or their incomes should be changed to blanks). The small numbers at the top take some educated guesswork. Because they range from 22 to 151, a reasonable guess, and hopefully one that can be confirmed, is that the person who entered these incomes thought of them as “thousands” and simply omitted the trailing three zeroes. If this is indeed correct, you can fix them by multiplying each by 1000. (There is an easy way to do this. Enter the multiple 1000 in some blank cell, and press Ctrl+c to copy it. Next, highlight the range G2:G12, click the Paste dropdown menu, select Paste Special, and check the Multiply option. Remember this trick. You can use it often.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, consider the Purchases (number of separate purchases by a customer) and Amount Spent (total spent on all purchases) columns. First, sort on Purchases. You will see the familiar 9999s at the bottom. In fact, each 9999 for Purchases has a corresponding 9999 for Amount Spent. This makes sense. If the number of purchases is unknown, the total amount spent is probably also unknown. You can effectively delete these 9999 rows by inserting a blank row right above them. Excel then automatically senses the boundary of the data. Essentially, a blank row or column imposes a separation from the “active” data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we examine the remaining data for these two variables. Presumably, there is a relationship between these variables, where the amount spent increases with the number of purchases. You can check this with a scatterplot of the (nonmissing) data, which is shown in Figure 4.46. There is a clear upward trend for most of the points, but there are some suspicious outliers at the bottom of the plot. Again, you might take an educated guess. Perhaps the average spent per purchase, rather than the total amount spent, was entered for a few of the customers. This would explain the abnormally small values. (It would also explain why these outliers are all at about the same height in the plot.) If you can locate these outliers in the data set, you can multiply each by the corresponding number of purchases (if your educated guess is correct). How do you locate them in the data set? First, sort on Amount Spent, then sort on Purchases. This will arrange the amounts spent in increasing order for each value of Purchases. Then, using the scatterplot as a guide, scroll through each value of Purchases (starting with 2) and locate the abnormally low values of Amount Spent, which are all together. This procedure is a bit tedious, but it is better than working with invalid data.</p>
