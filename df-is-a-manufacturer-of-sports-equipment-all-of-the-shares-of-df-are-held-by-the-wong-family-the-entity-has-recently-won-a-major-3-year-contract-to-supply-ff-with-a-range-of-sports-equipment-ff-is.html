            <p class="blog">DF is a manufacturer of sports equipment. All of the shares of DF are held by the Wong family.<br /> The entity has recently won a major 3-year contract to supply FF with a range of sports equipment. FF is a large entity with over 100 sports shops. The contract may be renewed after 3 years.<br /> The new contract is expected to double DF’s existing total annual sales, but demand from FF will vary considerably from month to month.<br /> The contract will, however, mean a significant additional investment in both non-current and current assets. A loan from the bank is to be used to finance the additional non-current assets, as the Wong family is currently unable to supply any further share capital. Also, the Wong family does not wish to raise new capital by issuing shares to non-family members. The financing of the additional current assets is yet to be decided. In particular, the contract with FF will require orders to be delivered within two days. This delivery period gives DF insufficient time to manufacture items, thus significant inventory need to be held at all times. Also, FF requires 90 days’ credit from its suppliers. This will result in a significant additional investment in trade receivables by DF.<br /> If the entity borrows from the bank to finance current assets, either using a loan or an overdraft, it expects to be charged annual interest at 12%. Consequently, DF is considering alternative methods of financing current assets. These include debt factoring, invoice discounting and offering a 3% cash discount to FF for settlement within 10 days rather than the normal 90 days.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Calculate the annual equivalent rate of interest implicit in offering a 3% cash discount to FF for settlement of debts within 10 days rather than 90 days. Briefly explain the factors, other than rate of interest, that DF would need to consider before deciding on whether to offer a cash discount.<br /> (b) Write a report to the Wong family shareholders explaining the various methods of financing available to DF to finance the additional current assets arising from the new FF contract. The report should include the following headings:</p> <p class="blog">(i) bank loan;<br /> (ii) overdraft;<br /> (iii) debt factoring;<br /> (iv) invoice discounting.</p>

This is a higher rate of interest than the 12% each year charged by the bank, but there are some benefits of offering a cash discount compared to bank finance:<br /> ● Gearing is not increased as with bank finance. Thus, the true cost of bank finance is not just 12% each year, but also the increase in the required rate of return by equity holders to compensate them for increased financial risk as a result of increased gearing.<br /> ● Bank finance may involve additional conditions such as more security in the form of fixed and/or floating charges and perhaps more debt covenants. These are likely to result in reduced financial flexibility for DF.<br /> ● Discounts are based upon current sales and future cash flows whereas bank finance may, at least in part, be constrained by historic performance and historic assets. There are, however, a number of problems with offering a cash discount:<br /> ● Other customers may require the same credit terms as those offered to FF;<br /> ● The annual equivalent rate of interest is quite high at 14.9%;<br /> ● The high cost of offering a discount may be worthwhile in overcoming initial liquidity difficulties arising from setting up this contract. However, once established, the discount may be difficult to withdraw when liquidity improves, without the loss of customer goodwill;</p>
 <p class="blog">
● The fact that a discount is offered does not mean it will be accepted. Thus, this form of finance is dependent upon FF taking up the discount at the terms being offered;<br /> ● It builds in the norm of a three-month settlement period, which might otherwise be subject to future negotiation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b)<br /> Report<br /> To: The Wong Family From: Management Accountant<br /> Subject: Financing of additional current assets from FF contract Date: 20 November 2001<br /> The financing of current assets<br /> Individual current assets such as inventory or trade receivables are temporary and should be realised into cash in the short term. Current assets as a pool, however, are, at least in part, permanent, as some are always needed. In the context of the FF contract, the total additional<br /> current assets needed are likely to have a permanent element, so long as the contract continues. Also, however, given that sales are expected to fluctuate from month to month, part of the current assets are likely to fluctuate from month to month. This will happen automatically with trade receivables and to the extent that such fluctuations are predictable, it will also happen with inventory.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A simple conclusion is, therefore, that the permanent element of current assets could be financed with long-term finance and the fluctuating element with short-term finance. This conclusion of time dependence is, however, subject to a range of other considerations. In addition, to some extent, the incremental current assets required for the FF contract are self-financing, in that, the additional sales will be partially matched by increased purchases for which credit terms are likely to be available from suppliers. These additional payables will go some way toward off-setting additional trade receivables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It should also be noted that the financing of incremental inventory needs to be considered in light of the existing inventory policy. Assuming that existing customers are supplied with similar goods to FF, the inventory holding policy needs to be considered as a whole, rather than separately for FF sales and other sales. In particular, if sales volumes double this does not mean that inventory needs to double. The Economic Order Quantity model would predict that inventory should increase in square root proportion to sales (that is by 41% when sales double). This, of course, depends upon the assumptions of the model holding and in particular the predictability of demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Predicting current asset requirements is vital in determining the necessary finance; thus management of working capital is an issue which needs to be considered simultaneously with financing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Bank loan<br /> The need for financing additional permanent (or hard core) current assets may be most appropriate to a medium term loan in terms of matching the timing. Such a loan in the short term if the conditions are met. Interest rates may also be fixed giving additional certainty. Disadvantages of an loan include:<br /> ● It is likely to come with additional conditions of further security and covenants;<br /> ● It will increase gearing and may increase the required return on equity due to increased financial risk thus the real cost would be above 12% each year;<br /> ● If existing gearing is high it may place a significant strain on the entity’s liquidity to the extent that bankruptcy may become a possibility, particularly as additional equity capital appears to be unavailable in a liquidity crises.<br /> Overdraft<br /> An overdraft must be repaid on demand and thus there are risks if it becomes part of permanent financing, or could not be repaid quickly from other sources of immediately available finance.<br /> An overdraft is, thus, a flexible form of financing which may be most appropriate for financing the fluctuating element of current assets, as interest will only be paid when the account is overdrawn.<br /> It is also likely that the necessary finance will be greater in the early months of the contract, as there will be no cash coming in for the first three months, but inventory needs to be established and payables (with terms of less than 90 days) will need to be paid. Thereafter, profitable trading from the contract should reduce the need for financing. As a<br /> result, an overdraft may be appropriate for temporary front-end finance needs.<br /> An overdraft does not always come into gearing calculations, but if it is significant and rolls over into the long term, it would have a similar effect to a loan in terms of financial risk. Also, similar security and covenants may be required. The question of the overdraft facility extended by the bank needs to be considered. If DF is close to this facility, it may be appropriate to use other means to finance the increase in current assets (see below) to leave the maximum financing flexibility with the remaining available overdraft.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Debt factoring<br /> Debt factoring may be defined as:<br /> ‘The sale of debts to a third party (the factor) at a discount, in return for prompt cash.’<br /> The nature of the service is likely to vary, but typically:<br /> ● an advance of about 80% of the invoice value is made immediately by the factor;<br /> ● the balance, less an interest charge (perhaps 3% over the base rate), is paid when the customer settles the account;<br /> ● the factor may take responsibility for managing the sales ledger for an additional fee (perhaps 2% of sales);<br /> ● factoring may be offered with or without recourse. With recourse is where the client entity takes the risk of bad debts. Without recourse is where the factor takes the bad debt risk. A further charge would be made for non-recourse debt factoring.<br /> The advantages of debt factoring include:<br /> ● cash is received immediately without security, covenants or increased gearing;<br /> ● the implied interest rates tend to be similar to other forms of finance as the service is offered in a competitive market;<br /> ● debt factors have economies of scale and specialist expertise in collecting debts and they may thus be more efficient then DF in this context;<br /> ● costs of maintaining the sales ledger are largely saved although some records are needed as a control over the factoring entity;<br /> ● bank finance tends to be based, in part at least, on historic sales and profits. Factoring is based upon current sales and profits. This tends to make more finance available when the business is growing, as is the case with DF.<br /> Problems and other considerations relating to factoring for DF include:<br /> ● it needs to be decided whether a factoring service is to be used for all trade receivables, only FF or only non-FF customers;<br /> ● FF, and indeed other customers, may lose confidence in DF’s continued solvency if they discover that a debt factor is being used;<br /> ● non-recourse finance will depend upon an estimate of FF’s creditworthiness relative to the charges the factor is likely to make.</p>
