            <p class="blog">ORDERING WITH QUANTITY DISCOUNTS AT SAM’S BOOKSTORE</p> <p class="blog">Sam’s Bookstore, with many locations across the United States, places orders for all of the latest books and then distributes them to its individual bookstores. Sam’s needs a model to help it order the appropriate number of any title. For example, Sam’s plans to order a popular new hardback novel, which it will sell for $30. It can purchase any number of this book from the publisher, but due to quantity discounts, the unit cost for all books it orders depends on the number ordered. Specifically, if the number ordered is less than 1000, the unit cost is $24. After each 1000, the unit cost drops: to $23 for at least 1000 copies; to $22.25 for at least 2000; to $21.75 for at least 3000; and to $21.30 (the lowest possible unit cost) for at least 4000. For example, if Sam’s orders 2500 books,its total cost is $22.25(2500) = $55,625. Sam’s is very uncertain about the demand for this book—it estimates that demand could be anywhere from 500 to 4500. Also, as with most hardback novels, this one will eventually come out in paperback. Therefore, if Sam’s has any hardbacks left when the paperback comes out, it will put them on sale for $10, at which price it believes all leftovers will be sold. How many copies of this hardback novel should Sam’s order from the publisher?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Business Objectives</strong> To create a model to determine the company’s profit, given fixed values of demand and the order quantity, and then to model the demand uncertainty explicitly and to choose the expected profit-maximizing order quantity.<br /> <strong>Excel Objectives</strong> To learn how to build in complex logic with IF formulas, to get help about Excel functions, to learn how to use lookup functions, to see how two-way data tables provide answers to more extensive what-if questions, and to learn about Excel’s SUMPRODUCT function.</p>

The big picture for this example appears in Figure 2.21. (See the file Ordering with Quantity Discounts Big Picture.xlsx.) It shows demand as an uncertain quantity that, together with the order quantity, determines the number sold and the eventual profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first step is to develop a spreadsheet model to calculate Sam’s profit for any order quantity and any possible demand. Then you can perform a sensitivity analysis to see how profit depends on these two quantities. Finally, you can decide how Sam’s might choose the optimal order quantity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Developing the Spreadsheet Model<br /> The profit model appears in Figure 2.22. (See the file Quantity Discounts Finished.xlsx.) Note that the order quantity and demand in the Order_quantity and Demand cells are trial values. (Comments in these cells are a reminder of this.) You can put any values in these cells, just to test the logic of the model. The Order_quantity cell is colored red because the company can choose its value. In contrast, the Demand cell is colored green here and in later chapters to indicate that this input value is uncertain and is being treated explicitly as such. Also, note that a table is used to indicate the quantity discounts cost structure. You can use the following steps to build the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1)Inputs and range names. Enter all inputs and name the ranges as indicated. Note that the Create from Selection shortcut was used to name all ranges except for CostLookup and Probabilities. For these latter two, you can select the ranges and enter the names in the Name Box—the “manual” method. (Why the difference? To use the Create from Selection shortcut, you must have appropriate labels in adjacent cells. Sometimes this is simply not convenient.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 Revenues. The company can sell only what it has, and it sells any leftovers at the discounted sale price. Therefore, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MIN(Order_quantity,Demand)<br /> =IF(Order_quantity&gt;Demand, Order_quantity−Demand,0)<br /> and<br /> =Units_sold_at_regular_price*Regular_price<br /> +Units_sold_at_leftover_price*Leftover_price</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells B15, B16, and B17. The logic in the first two of these cells is necessary to account correctly for the cases when the order quantity is greater than demand and when it is less than or equal to demand. Note that you could use the following equivalent alternative to the IF function in cell B16. (Make sure you understand why.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
=MAX(Order_quantity−Demand,0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: <span class="tex-text">\(f_{x}\)</span> Button and Function Library Group<br /> If you want to learn more about how an Excel function operates, click the <span class="tex-text">\(f_{x}\)</span> button next to the Formula bar. This is called the Insert Function button. If there is already a function,such as an IF function, in a cell and you then click the <span class="tex-text">\(f_{x}\)</span>button, you will get help on this function. If you select an empty cell and then click the <span class="tex-text">\(f_{x}\)</span>button, you can choose a function to get help on. (The same help is available from the Function Library group on the Formulas ribbon.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
3)Total ordering cost. Depending on the order quantity, you can find the appropriate unit cost from the unit cost table and multiply it by the order quantity to obtain the total ordering cost. This can be accomplished with a complex nested IF formula, but a much better way is to use the VLOOKUP function. Specifically, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=VLOOKUP(Order_quantity,CostLookup,2)*Order_quantit y</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B18. The VLOOKUP part of this formula says to compare the order quantity to the first (leftmost) column of the table in the CostLookup range and return the corresponding value in the second column (because the last argument is 2).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: VLOOKUP<br /> The VLOOKUP function acts like a tax table, where you look up the tax corresponding to your adjusted gross income from a table of incomes and taxes. To use it, first create a vertical lookup table, with values to use for comparison listed in the left column of the table and corresponding output values in as many columns to the right as you like. (See the CostLookup range in Figure 2.22 for an example.) Then the VLOOKUP function takes three or four arguments: (1) the value you want to compare to the values in the left column; (2) the lookup table range; (3) the index of the column you want the returned value to come from, where the index of the left column is 1, the index of the next column is 2, and so on; and optionally (4) TRUE (for an approximate match, the default) or FALSE (for an exact match). If you omit the last argument, the values in the left column of the table must be entered in ascending order. If the last argument is TRUE or is omitted, Excel scans down the leftmost column of the table and finds the last entry less than or equal to the first argument. (In this sense, it finds an approximate match.) There is also an HLOOKUP function that works exactly the same way, except that the lookup table is arranged in rows, not columns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4)Profit. Calculate the profit with the formula<br /> =Revenue−Cost</p>
 <p class="blog">
Two-Way Data Table<br /> The next step is to create a two-way data table for profit as a function of the order quantity and demand (see Figure 2.23). To create this table, first enter a link to the profit with the formula 5Profit in cell A22, and enter possible order quantities and possible demands in column A and row 22, respectively. (We used the same values for both order quantity and demand, from 500 to 4500 in increments of 500. This is not necessary—the demand could change in increments of 100 or even 1—but it is reasonable. Perhaps Sam’s is required by the publisher to order in multiples of 500.) Then select Data Table from the What-If Analysis dropdown list on the Data ribbon, and enter the Demand cell as the Row Input cell and the Order_quantity cell as the Column Input cell (see Figure 2.24).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: Two-Way Data Table<br /> A two-way data table allows you to see how a single output cell varies as you vary two input cells. (Unlike a one-way data table, only a single output cell can be chosen.) To create this type of table, enter a reference to the output cell in the top- left corner of the table, enter possible values of the two inputs below and to the right of this corner cell, and select the entire table. Then select Data Table from the What-If Analysis dropdown on the Data ribbon, and enter references to the cells where the original two input variables live.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Row Input cell corresponds to the values along the top row of the table, and the Column Input cell corresponds to the values along the left column of the table. When you click OK, Excel substitutes each pair of input values into these two input cells, recalculates the spreadsheet, and enters the corresponding output value in the table. By selecting any cell in the body of the table, you can see that Excel also enters the function TABLE as a reminder that the cell is part of a data table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resulting data table shows that profit depends heavily on both order quantity and demand and (by scanning across rows) how higher demands lead to larger profits. But which order quantity Sam’s should select is still unclear. Remember that Sam’s has complete control over the order quantity (it can choose the row of the data table), but it has no direct control over demand (it cannot choose the column).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The ordering decision depends not only on which demands are possible but also on which demands are likely to occur. The usual way to express this information is with a set of probabilities that sum to 1. Suppose Sam’s estimates these as the values in row 35 of Figure 2.25. These estimates are probably based on other similar books it has sold in the past. The most likely demands are 2000 and 2500, with other values on both sides less likely. You can use these probabilities to find an expected profit for each order quantity. This expected profit is a weighted average of the profits in any row in the data table, using the probabilities as the weights. The easiest way to do this is to enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMPRODUCT(B23:J23,Probabilities)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B38 and copy it down to cell B46. You can also create a bar chart of these expected profits, as shown in Figure 2.25. Excel refers to these as column charts. The height of each bar is the expected profit for that particular order quantity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
than two range arguments, all of the same size and shape, but the most common use of SUMPRODUCT is when only two ranges are involved.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The largest of the expected profits, $12,250, corresponds to an order quantity of 2000, so we would recommend that Sam’s order 2000 copies of the book. This does not guarantee that Sam’s will make a profit of $12,250—the actual profit depends on the eventual demand—but it represents a reasonable way to proceed in the face of uncertain demand.<br /> You will learn much more about making decisions under uncertainty and the expected value criterion in Chapter 9.</p>
