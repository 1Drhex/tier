<strong>Case (a): Product Composition <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span> Is Measured </strong><strong>On-Line</strong><br /> First, we select the CVs. Because the chief objective for an evaporator is to produce a product stream with a specified composition, mole fraction <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span> is the primary CV (Guideline 3). Liquid level h must be controlled because of operating constraints and safety considerations (Guideline 2). If the level is too high, liquid could be entrained in the solvent stream; if the level is too low, the tubes of the steam chest would be exposed to vapor, rather than liquid, a potentially dangerous situation. In this latter situation, the heat transfer rate from the steam to the evaporator liquid would be significantly lower, and thus overheating and damage to the steam chest could result. Pressure P should also be controlled, because it has a major influence on the evaporator operation (Guideline 2). Large pressure variations affect the temperature T and could shift the boiling regime from film boiling to nucleate boiling, or vice versa. This type of regime shift could produce a major process upset. For these reasons, three CVs are selected: <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span>, h, and P.<br /> Next we select the MVs. Because the feed conditions cannot be adjusted, the obvious MVs are B, D, and <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span>. Product flow rate B has a significant effect on h, but relatively small effects on P and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span>. Therefore, it is reasonable to control h by manipulating B (Guideline 6) unless B is only a small fraction of F (for example, less than 10%). In this latter case, it would be desirable to have F become an MV. Vapor flow rate D has a direct and rapid effect on P but has less direct effects on h and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span>. Thus, P should be paired with D (Guideline 6). This leaves the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}-x_{B}\)</span> pairing for the third control loop. This pairing is physically reasonable, because the most direct way of regulating <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span> is by adjusting the evaporation of solvent via the steam pressure (Guideline 8).<br /> Finally, we consider which process variables to measure. Clearly, the three CVs should be measured. It is also desirable to measure the three MVs because this information is useful for controller tuning and troubleshooting. If large and frequent feed disturbances occur, measurements of disturbance variables F and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{F}\)</span> could be used in a feedforward control strategy that would complement the feedback control scheme. It is not necessary to measure <span class="tex-text">\(T_{F}\)</span>, because sensible heat changes in the feed stream are typically small compared to the heat fluxes in the evaporator.<br /> A schematic diagram of the controlled evaporator for Case (a) is shown in first Figure on the right.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Case (b): Product Composition Cannot Be Measured On-Line<br /> </strong>The CVs are the same as in Case (a), but, because the third controlled variable <span class="tex-text">\(x_{B}\)</span> cannot be measured, standard feedback control is not possible. A simple feedforward control strategy can be developed based on a steady-state component balance for the solute,<strong><br /> </strong><span class="tex-text">\(0=\bar{F}\bar{x}_{F}-\bar{B}\bar{x}_{B}\)</span><br /> where the bar denotes the nominal steady-state value. Rearranging gives<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{B}=\bar{F}\frac{\bar{x}_{F}}{\bar{x}_{B}} \)</span> (1)<br /> Equation (1) provides the basis for the feedforward control law. Replacing <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{B} \space and \space \bar{F}\)</span> by the actual flow rates, B(t) and F(t), and replacing <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{x}_{B}\)</span> by the set-point value, <span class="tex-text">\(x_{Bsp}\)</span>, gives<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(B(t)=F(t)\frac{\bar{x}_{F}}{x_{Bsp}} \)</span> (2)<br /> Thus B is adjusted based on the measured value of F, the set point <span class="tex-text">\(x_{Bsp}\)</span>, and the nominal value of the feed composition, <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{x}_{F}\)</span>.<br /> The MVs are the same as for Case (a): D, B, and <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span>. Bottom flow rate B has already been used in the feedforward control strategy of Equation (2). Clearly, the P-D pairing is still desirable for the reasons given for Case (a). This leaves h to be controlled by adjusting the rate of evaporation via <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span>. A schematic diagram of the controlled evaporator is shown in second Figure on the right.<br /> This control strategy has two disadvantages. First, it is based on the assumption that the unmeasured feed composition is constant at a known steady-state value.<br /> Second, because the feedforward control technique was based on a steady-state analysis, it may not perform well during transient conditions. Nevertheless, this scheme provides a simple, indirect method for controlling a product composition when it cannot be measured.</p>
