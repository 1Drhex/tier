(a) Cash is the most liquid of assets, and it is also the most tangible. A banknote with a face value of $10 can be held in the hand, and there can be no dispute that maybe it is really $11 or $9. Profits, however, are not tangible or liquid, and it is possible to argue that profit should be restated at a higher (or lower) amount.<br /> With simple income and expenditure accounts, the excess corresponds to an amount of cash, and is therefore difficult to manipulate. But, with accruals accounting, problems of estimation arise (e.g. how much to provide for depreciation and bad debts). In the case of modern, multinational groups of entities, the potential for manipulation of profit is much greater still.<br /> It is possible, however, to manipulate cash flows and balances as well as profits. Cash balances can be boosted at the year end by withholding payment to suppliers; customers can be given incentives to pay any large balances; loans can be taken out (and repaid immediately after the year end); and assets can be sold for cash.<br /> The International Accounting Standards Committee has been developing and issuing financial reporting standards which attempt to minimise the opportunities for manipulation of profits, cash flows and balances.<br /> (b) Positive cash flows are extremely important for entities to ensure their survival. Many very profitable entities have gone into liquidation simply because of their inability to generate sufficient cash. But in the longer term, entities that are unable to make profits will cease to generate cash, and will also fold. Of the two, the ability to generate profits is the most important for the long-term security of the entity. By focusing purely on increasing cash balances, the managers of an entity might neglect their main task, which is to make a profit for shareholders.<br /> It is also not in the best interests of an entity to habitually hold large cash deposits (unless interest rates are running at an abnormally high rate). It makes more sense for the directors to reinvest available funds in non-current assets, which should increase the entity’s profitability. The entity’s working capital management policy should ensure that enough cash is held to meet its day-to-day requirements, but no more. In the same way, as an entity gains nothing from carrying very large amounts of excess inventory, it is likely that better returns can be found for excess cash by alternative investments.</p>
