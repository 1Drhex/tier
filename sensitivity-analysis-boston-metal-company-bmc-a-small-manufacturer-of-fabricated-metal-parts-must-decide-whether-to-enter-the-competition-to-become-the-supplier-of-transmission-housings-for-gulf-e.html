            <p class="blog">Sensitivity Analysis</p> <p class="blog">Boston Metal Company (BMC), a small manufacturer of fabricated metal parts, must decide whether to enter the competition to become the supplier of transmission housings for Gulf Electric, a company that produces the housings in its own in-house manufacturing facility, but that has almost reached its maximum production capacity. Therefore, Gulf is looking for an outside supplier. To compete, BMC must design a new fixture for the production process and purchase a new forge. The available details for this purchase are as follows:</p> <p class="blog">• The new forge would cost <span class="tex-text">\(\$125,000\)</span>. This total includes retooling costs for the transmission housings.</p> <p class="blog">• If BMC gets the order, it may be able to sell as many as <span class="tex-text">\(2,000\)</span> units per year to Gulf Electric for <span class="tex-text">\(\$50\)</span> each, in which case variable production costs,<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span> such as direct labor and direct material costs, will be <span class="tex-text">\(\$15\)</span> per unit. The increase in fixed costs,<span class="tex-text">\(^3\)</span> other than depreciation, will amount to <span class="tex-text">\(\$10,000\)</span> per year.</p> <p class="blog">• The firm expects that the proposed transmission-housings project will have about a five-year product life. The firm also estimates that the amount ordered by Gulf Electric in the first year will be ordered in each of the subsequent four years. (Due to the nature of contracted production, the annual demand and unit price would remain the same over the project after the contract is signed.)</p> <p class="blog">• The initial investment can be depreciated on a MACRS basis over a seven-year period, and the marginal income tax rate is expected to remain at <span class="tex-text">\(40\%\)</span>. At the end of five years, the forge is expected to retain a market value of about <span class="tex-text">\(32\%\)</span> of the original investment.</p> <p class="blog">• On the basis of this information, the engineering and marketing staffs of BMC have prepared the cash flow forecasts shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Table 12.1\)</span>. Since the <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span> is positive <span class="tex-text">\((\$40,168)\)</span> at the <span class="tex-text">\(15\%\)</span> opportunity cost of capital <span class="tex-text">\((MARR)\)</span>, the project appears to be worth undertaking.</p> <p class="blog">What Makes BMC Managers Worry: BMC’s managers are uneasy about this project, because too many uncertain elements have not been considered in the analysis:</p> <p class="blog">• If it decided to take on the project, BMC would have to invest in the forging machine to provide Gulf Electric with some samples as a part of the bidding process. If Gulf Electric were not to like BMC’s sample, BMC would stand to lose its entire investment in the forging machine.</p> <p class="blog">• If Gulf were to like BMC’s sample, then if it was overpriced, BMC would be under pressure to bring the price in line with competing firms. Even the possibility that BMC would get a smaller order must be considered, as Gulf may utilize its overtime capacity to produce some extra units. Finally, BMC is not certain about its projections of variable and fixed costs.</p> <p class="blog">Recognizing these uncertainties, the managers want to assess the various possible future outcomes before making a final decision. Put yourself in BMC’s management position, and describe how you may resolve the uncertainty associated with the project. In doing so, perform a sensitivity analysis for each variable and develop a sensitivity graph.</p> <p class="blog">DISCUSSION: Table 12.1 shows BMC’s expected cash flows—but that they will indeed materialize cannot be assumed. In particular, BMC is not very confident in its revenue forecasts. The managers think that if competing firms enter the market,</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="539"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="7" width="539">TABLE 12.1 After-Tax Cash Flow for BMC’s Transmission-Housings Project (Example 12.1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="7">Revenues:</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Unit price</td> <td></td> <td>$ 50</td> <td>$ 50</td> <td>$ 50</td> <td>$ 50</td> <td>$ 50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Demand (units)</td> <td></td> <td>2,000</td> <td>2,000</td> <td>2,000</td> <td>2,000</td> <td>2,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sales revenue</td> <td></td> <td>$100,000</td> <td>$100,000</td> <td>$100,000</td> <td>$100,000</td> <td>$100,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Expenses:</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Unit variable cost</td> <td></td> <td>$ 15</td> <td>$ 15</td> <td>$ 15</td> <td>$ 15</td> <td>$ 15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Variable cost</td> <td></td> <td>30,000</td> <td>30,000</td> <td>30,000</td> <td>30,000</td> <td>30,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fixed cost</td> <td></td> <td>10,000</td> <td>10,000</td> <td>10,000</td> <td>10,000</td> <td>10,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Depreciation</td> <td></td> <td>17,863</td> <td>30,613</td> <td>21,863</td> <td>15,613</td> <td>5,575</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taxable income</td> <td></td> <td>$ 42,137</td> <td>$ 29,387</td> <td>$ 38,137</td> <td>$ 44,387</td> <td>$ 54,425</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Income taxes (40%)</td> <td></td> <td>16,855</td> <td>11,755</td> <td>15,255</td> <td>17,755</td> <td>21,770</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="77">Net income</td> <td width="77"></td> <td width="77">$ 25,282</td> <td width="77">$ 17,632</td> <td width="77">$ 22,882</td> <td width="77">$ 26,632</td> <td width="77">$ 32,655</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="7">Cash flow statement:</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Operating activities:</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net income</td> <td></td> <td>25,282</td> <td>17,632</td> <td>22,882</td> <td>26,632</td> <td>32,655</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Depreciation</td> <td></td> <td>17,863</td> <td>30,613</td> <td>21,863</td> <td>15,613</td> <td>5,575</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Investment activities:</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Investment</td> <td>(125,000)</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Salvage</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>40,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gains tax</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>(2,611)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net cash flow</td> <td>$(125,500)</td> <td>$ 43,145</td> <td>$ 48,245</td> <td>$ 44,745</td> <td>$ 42,245</td> <td>$ 75,619</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Sensitivity analysis: We begin the sensitivity analysis with a consideration of the base-case situation, which reflects the best estimate (expected value) for each input variable. In developing <span class="tex-text">\(Table 12.2\)</span>, we changed a given variable by <span class="tex-text">\(20\%\)</span> in <span class="tex-text">\(5\%\)</span> increments, above and below the base-case value, and calculated new <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span>s, while other variables were held constant. The values for both sales and operating costs were the expected, or base-case, values, and the resulting <span class="tex-text">\(\$40,169\)</span> is the base-case <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span>. Now we ask a series of “what-if” questions: What if sales are 20% below the expected level? What if operating costs rise? What if the unit price drops from <span class="tex-text">\(\$50\)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\(\$45\)</span>? <span class="tex-text">\(Table 12.2\)</span> summarizes the results of varying the values of the key input variables.</p>

Sensitivity graph: Next, we construct a sensitivity graph for five of the transmission project’s key input variables. (See <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.1.\)</span>) We plot the base-case <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span> on the ordinate of the graph at the value 1.0 on the abscissa (or <span class="tex-text">\(0\%\)</span> deviation). Then we reduce the value of product demand to 0.95 of its base-case value and recompute the <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span> with all other variables held at their base-case value. We repeat the process by either decreasing or increasing the relative deviation from the base case. The lines for the variable unit price, variable unit cost, fixed cost, and salvage value are obtained in the same manner. In <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.1\)</span>, we see that the project’s <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span> is (1) very sensitive to changes in product demand and unit price, (2) fairly sensitive to changes in variable costs, and (3) relatively insensitive to changes in the fixed cost and the salvage value.</p>
