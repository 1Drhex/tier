            <p class="blog">Projecting the Costs of Bookshelves at Woodworks<br /> The Woodworks Company produces a variety of custom-designed wood furniture for its customers. One favorite item is a bookshelf, made from either cherry or oak. The company knows that wood prices and labor costs are likely to increase in the future. Table 2.1 shows the number of board-feet and labor hours required for a bookshelf, the current costs per board-foot and labor hour, and the anticipated annual increases in these costs. (The top row indicates that either type of bookshelf requires 30 board-feet of wood and 16 hours of labor.) Build a spreadsheet model that enables the company to experiment with the growth rates in wood and labor costs so that a manager can see, both numerically and graphically, how the costs of the bookshelves vary in the next few years.</p> Table 2.1 Input Data for Manufacturing a Bookshelf:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 722px; height: 246px;" border="0" width="288" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Labor</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Oak</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Cherry</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Resource</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">16</td> <td dir="LTR">30</td> <td dir="LTR">30</td> <td dir="LTR">Resource Cherry Oak Labor Required per bookshelf</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$18.50</td> <td dir="LTR">$4.30</td> <td dir="LTR">$5.50</td> <td dir="LTR">Current unit cost</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">1.5%</td> <td dir="LTR">1.7%</td> <td dir="LTR">2.4%</td> <td dir="LTR">ticipated annual cost increase</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Business Objectives<span class="tex-text">\(.^3\)</span></strong> To build a model that allows Woodworks to see, numerically and graphically, how its costs of manufacturing bookshelves increase in the future and to allow the company to answer what-if questions with this model.<br /> <strong>Excel Objectives</strong> To learn good spreadsheet practices, to enable copying formulas with the careful use of relative and absolute addresses, and to create line charts from multiple series of data.</p>

The essence of spreadsheet modeling is transforming a “story problem” into an Excel model. Based on our teaching experience, a bridge between the two is often needed, especially for complex models. In earlier editions of the book, we provided a table of key variables and their roles in the model, but we now have access to a relatively new Excel add- in, BigPicture. This is part of the Palisade DecisionTools Suite, so it is available with the book. BigPicture is essentially a drawing add-in that supplements Excel’s built-in drawing tools. From here on, most examples in the book will start with a “big picture” to help you understand the model—what the key elements are and how they are related—and get you ready for the eventual spreadsheet model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We have created these big pictures so that you don’t have to. However, you have the software, and you might want to use it to draw your own big pictures. Actually, the point is not that you need to learn new software. If you find these big pictures helpful, you could create similar drawings with built-in Excel tools only, or you could even draw them with paper and pencil. The real point is that drawings of this type force you to think carefully about the relationships in a model and how they can then translate into a spreadsheet model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Each big picture is in its own Excel file, such as <strong>Bookshelf Costs Big Picture.xlsx </strong>for this example. (As with the example files, these big picture files are available at www .cengagebrain.com.) A screenshot of this big picture appears in Figure 2.6, but when you load the BigPicture add-in (from the Palisade group of programs) and then open the big picture file, you can see more than this static diagram. First, each of the shapes in the diagram (called “topics” in the software) can have a “note,” much like an Excel cell comment. When you move the cursor over the topic, the note appears. Second, the software allows you to create slide shows. We have done this for all of the big pictures in the book. This lets you see how the model “evolves,” and each slide is accompanied by a “pop-up” text box explanation to help you understand the model even better. (To run the slide show, click the Play button on the BigPicture ribbon and then the Next Slide button for each new slide. When you are finished, click the Stop button.) Just remember that these slide shows are possible only when the BigPicture add-in is loaded.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We have adopted a color-coding/shape convention for these big pictures. You can see the shapes on the printed page, and you can see the colors and shapes when you open the file.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ Blue rectangles indicate given inputs.<br /> ■ Red ovals indicate decision variables.<br /> ■ Green rectangles with rounded tops indicate uncertain quantities.<br /> ■ Yellow rounded rectangles indicate calculated quantities.<br /> ■ Shapes with thin gray borders indicate bottom line outputs or quantities to optimize.<br /> ■ Arrows indicate that one quantity helps determine another. However, if an arrow includes an inequality or equality sign, as you will often see in the next few optimization chapters, the arrow indicates a constraint.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As the big picture in Figure 2.6 indicates, you start with the current wood costs and the projected annual increases in wood costs to project the annual costs of wood. You do this similarly for labor costs. Then you use these costs, along with wood and labor requirements per bookshelf, to project the annual total costs of bookshelves.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed spreadsheet model appears in Figure 2.7 and in the file Bookshelf Costs Finished.xlsx. You can develop it with the following steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>1-Inputs</strong>. You should usually enter the inputs for a model in the upper-left corner of a worksheet as you can see in the shaded ranges in Figure 2.7. We have used our standard convention of coloring inputs—the numbers from the statement of the problem—blue. You can develop your own convention, but the input cells should be distinguished in some way. Note that the inputs are grouped logically and are explained with appropriate labels.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You should always document your spreadsheet model with informational labels. Also, note that by entering inputs explicitly in input cells, you can refer to them later in Excel formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>2-Design output table</strong>. Plan ahead for how you want to structure your outputs. We created a table where there is a row for every year in the future (year 0 corresponds to the current year), there are three columns for projected unit costs (columns B–D), and there are two columns for projected total bookshelf costs (columns E–F). The headings reflect this design. Of course, this isn’t the only possible design, but it works well. The important point is that you should have some logical design in mind before diving in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3-Projected unit costs of wood. The dollar values in the range B19:F25 are all calculated from Excel formulas. Although the logic in this example is straightforward, it is still important to have a strategy in mind before you enter formulas. In particular, you should always try to design your spreadsheet so that you can enter a single formula and then copy it. This saves work and avoids errors. For the costs per board-foot in columns B and C, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B9<br /> in cell B19 and copy it to cell C19. Then enter the general formula<br /> =B19*(1+B$10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B20 and copy it to the range B20:C25. We assume you know the rules for absolute and relative addresses (dollar sign for absolute, no dollar sign for relative), but it takes some planning to use these so that copying is possible. Make sure you understand why we made row 10 absolute but column B relative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Always try to organize your spreadsheet model so that you can copy formulas across multiple cells.</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip:</strong> Relative and Absolute Addresses in Formulas Relative and absolute addresses are used in Excel formulas to facilitate copying. A dollar sign next to a column or row address indicates that the address is absolute and will not change when copying. The lack of a dollar sign indicates that the address is relative and will change when copying. After you select a cell in a formula, you can press the F4 key repeatedly to cycle through the relative/absolute possibilities, for example, =B4 (both column and row relative), =$B$4 (both column and row absolute), =B$4 (column relative, row absolute), and =$B4 (column absolute, row relative).</p>
 <p class="blog">
4-Projected unit labor costs. To calculate projected hourly labor costs, enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=B13<br /> in cell D19. Then enter the formula<br /> =D19*(11B$14)<br /> in cell D20 and copy it down column D.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5-Projected bookshelf costs. Each bookshelf cost is the sum of its wood and labor costs. By a careful use of absolute and relative addresses, you can enter a single formula for these costs—for all years and for both types of wood. To do this, enter the formula<br /> =B$5*B19+B$6*$D19</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell E19 and copy it to the range E19:F25. The idea here is that the units of wood and labor per bookshelf are always in rows 5 and 6, and the projected unit labor cost is always in column D, but all other references are relative to allow copying.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6-Chart. A chart is a valuable addition to any table of data, especially in the business world, so charting in Excel is a skill worth mastering. Although not everyone agrees, the many changes Microsoft made regarding charts in Excel 2007 and later versions help you create charts more efficiently and effectively. We illustrate some of the possibilities here, but we urge you to experiment with other possibilities on your own. Start by selecting the range E18:F25—yes, including the labels in row 18. Next, click the Line dropdown list on the Insert ribbon and select the Line with Markers type. You instantly get the basic line chart you want, with one series for Cherry and another for Oak. Also, when the chart is selected (that is, it has a border around it), you see Chart Tools tabs. Specifically, in Excel 2013 and later versions, there are two Chart Tools tabs, Design and Format, and there are three useful buttons to the right of the chart. (These three buttons were new to Excel 2013, and the two tabs condense the tools in the three tabs from Excel 2007 and 2010.) The most important button is the Select Data button on the Design ribbon. It lets you choose the ranges of the data for charting in case Excel’s default choices aren’t what you want. (The default choices are based on the selected range when you create the chart.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Click Select Data now to obtain the dialog box in Figure 2.8. On the left, you control the series (one series or multiple series) being charted; on the right, you control the data used for the horizontal axis. By selecting E18:F25, you have the series on the left correct, including the names of these series (Cherry and Oak), but if you didn’t, you could select one of the series and click the Edit button to change it. The data on the horizontal axis is currently the default 1, 2, and so on. To make it the data in column A, click the Edit button on the right and select the range A19:A25. (See Figure 2.9.) Your chart is now correctly labeled and charts the correct data. Beyond this, you can experiment with various formatting options to make the chart even better. For example, we rescaled the vertical axis to start at $300 rather than $0 (right-click any of the numbers on the vertical axis and select<br /> Format Axis), and we added a chart title at the top and a title for the horizontal axis at the bottom (in Excel 2013 and later versions, click the plus sign button next to the chart to get chart title and axis title options). You can spend a lot of time fine- tuning charts—maybe even too much time—but professional looking charts are definitely appreciated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using the Model for What-If Questions</strong><br /> The model in Figure 2.7 can now be used to answer many what-if questions. In fact, many models are built for the purpose of permitting experimentation with various scenarios. The important point is that the model has been<br /> built in such a way that a manager can enter any desired values in the input cells, and all of the outputs, including the chart, will update automatically. As a simple example, if the annual percentage increases for wood costs are twice as<br /> high as Woodworks anticipated, you can enter these higher values in row 10 and immediately see the effect, as shown in Figure 2.10. By comparing bookshelf costs in this scenario to those in the original scenario, the projected cost in year 6 for cherry bookshelves, for example, increases by about 5.5%, from $513.89 to $542.26. You should appreciate by now why burying input numbers inside Excel formulas is such a bad practice. For example, if you had buried the annual increases of wood costs from row 10 in the formulas in columns B and C, imagine how difficult it would be to answer the what-if question in the previous paragraph. You would first have to find and then change all the numbers in the formulas, which is a lot of work and can easily lead to errors.</p>

<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Power of Charts<br /> A chart is typically much more informative to a business manager than the table of numbers it is based on. Don’t underestimate the power of Excel charts for getting your points across, and include them in your spreadsheet models whenever possible. However, be prepared to do some investigating on your own. Excel offers an abundance of chart types and chart options to choose from, and they are not all equally suited to telling your story.</p>
