This is another question that emphasizes the fact that probability all depends on the information you know. Some of the information you are given here is indeed irrelevant (the three years apart and the North Wales are irrelevant). The information you have is that one of the children is a boy. There are now three possibilities for the sexes of Mrs Trellis’ children (in order of seniority):</p>
 <p class="blog">
(1) boy; boy,<br /> (2) boy; girl,<br /> (3) girl; boy.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The fourth possibility you might think of, “girl; girl”, is discounted by the information that one of the children is a boy. Thus the probability that Mrs Trellis has a daughter is <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> [assuming of course that Mrs Trellis has a 50:50 chance of producing a male or female baby at every birth]. The reason that the answer to this question is not <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is that we don’t know which of Mrs Trellis’ two children our initial bit of information refers to (i.e., that the child is a boy), whether it refers to the older or the younger one. Forget older versus younger, we could distinguish between the two children in many different ways: in order of height, weight, number of freckles, etc. Thus the table of possibilities listed above could be written, not in order of seniority, but in order of height, darkness of hair, blueness of eyes, etc. So, if instead we were told that it was the taller of the children that was a boy, then amazingly that additional information changes the probabilities. All our attention is now focused on the other child, the shorter one, who can either be male or female. It’s now a probability of <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> that the shorter child is a daughter. Astonishingly, knowledge of the height of one of the children alters the probability of sex, even though we have assumed that height and sex are uncorrelated. If you like, we could have replaced the statement “the taller of the children was a boy” with “the child with a first name earlier in the alphabet was a boy” and that would also have the same effect! This demonstrates the important r<span class="tex-text">\(\hat{o}\)</span>le of distinguishability in statistics, a concept that will return!</p>
