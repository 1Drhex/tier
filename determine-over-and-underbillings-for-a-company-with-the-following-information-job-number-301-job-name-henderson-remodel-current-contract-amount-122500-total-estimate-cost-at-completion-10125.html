First let’s look at the Henderson remodel. The contract amount is $122,500 and is entered in Column C. The total estimated cost at completion is $101,256 and is entered in Column D. The estimated profit is calculated by subtracting the current contract amount from the total esti-mated cost at completion as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Estimated Profit = $122,500 &#8211; $101,256 = $21,244<br /> The estimated profit is recorded in Column E. The actual costs to date are $95,265 and are entered in Column F. Earned profit is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Earned Profit =<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{Estimated Profit \times Actual Costs to Date}{Total Estimated Costs at Completion} \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Earned Profit=<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\$21,244 × \$95,265}{\$101,256}\)</span> =$19,987</p>
 <p class="blog">
The earned profit is recorded in Column G. Costs and earned profit are calculated as follows:<br /> Costs and Earned Profit = $95,265 + $19,987 = $115,25</p>
 <p class="blog">
The costs and earned profit are recorded in Column H. The total billed for the job is $110,687 and is entered in Column I. Because the job has been billed less than the costs and earned profit, the job is underbilled or has costs and prof-its in excess of billings. The underbillings are calculated by subtracting the total billed from the costs and earned prof-its as follows:<br /> Underbillings = $115,252 &#8211; $110,687 = $4,565<br /> The underbillings are recorded in Column J. Billings in ex-cess of costs and profits—Column K—are zero, because the job is underbilled. The percentage complete is calcu-lated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Percent Complete=<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{Actual Costs to Date}{Total Estimated Costs at Completion } (100)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Percent Complete=<span class="tex-text">\(=\frac{$95,265}{$101,256} (100)=94%\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The percentage complete is recorded in Column L. The Weston Offices and Johnson Warehouse are calculated in the same manner, except that both projects are overbilled. As a result, both the project’s costs and profits in excess of billings are zero. The billings in excess of costs and profit for the Weston Offices are $1,053 and for the Johnson Warehouse $1,998. For the entire company, the total costs and profits in excess of billings are $4,565 ($4,564 + $0 + $0) and the total billings in excess of costs and profits are $3,051 ($1,053 + $1,998). The work on hand spreadsheet is shown in Figure 4.</p>
