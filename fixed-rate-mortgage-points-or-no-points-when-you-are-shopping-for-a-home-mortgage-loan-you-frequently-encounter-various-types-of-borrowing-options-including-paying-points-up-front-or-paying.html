            <p class="blog"><strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgage—Points or No Points?</strong></p> <p class="blog">When you are shopping for a home mortgage loan, you frequently encounter various types of borrowing options, including paying points up front or paying no points but accepting a slightly higher interest rate. Suppose you want to finance a home mortgage of $100,000 at a 15-year fixed-interest rate. A leading independent home lender offers the following two options with no origination fees:</p> <p class="blog"><strong>• Option 1:</strong> Pay one point with 6.375% interest.<br /> <strong>• Option 2:</strong> Pay no points with 6.75% interest.</p> <p class="blog">Recall that a point is equivalent to 1% of the face value of the mortgage. In other words, with option 1, you are borrowing only $99,000, but your lender will calculate your monthly payments on the basis of $100,000. Compute the APR for option 1. Which option would you select?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Discussion:</strong> Discount fees or points are a fact of life with mortgages. A point is a fee charged by a lender to increase the lender’s effective yield on the money borrowed. Points are charged in lieu of interest; the more points paid, the lower is the rate of interest required on the loan to provide the same yield or return to the lender. Origination fees are the fees charged by a lender to prepare a loan document, make credit checks, inspect, and sometimes appraise a property. These fees are usually computed as a percentage of the face value of the mortgage.</p>

<strong>Given:</strong> P = $100,000, r = 6.375%, N = 180 months, and discount point = 1 point.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> APR.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We first need to find out how much the lender will calculate your monthly payments to be. Since the mortgage payments will be based on the face value of the loan, your monthly payment will be</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">A = $100,000(A/P, 6.375%/12, 180) = $864.25</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because you have to pay $1,000 to borrow $100,000, you are actually borrowing $99,000. Therefore, you need to find out what kind of interest you are actually paying. In other words, you borrow $99,000 and you make $864.25 monthly payments over 15 years. To find the interest rate, you can set up the following equivalence equation and solve for the unknown interest rate.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">$99,000 = $864.25(P/A, i, 180)<br /> i = 0.545% per month<br /> APR = 0.545% <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 12 = 6.54%</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that with a one-point fee, the lender was able to raise its effective yield from 6.375% to 6.54%. However, the lender is still earning less than option 2 affords.</p>
