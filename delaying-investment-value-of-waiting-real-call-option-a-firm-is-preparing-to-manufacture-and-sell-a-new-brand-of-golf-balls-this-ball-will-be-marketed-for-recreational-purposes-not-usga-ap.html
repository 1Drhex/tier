<strong>Given:</strong> Estimated project cash flows, required investment = $50 million, risk-free rate = 6%, risk-adjusted discount rate = 12%, <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma\)</span> = 50%, and T = 2 years.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Option value for deferring the investment for two years.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Conventional Approach: Should the Firm Invest Today?</strong> If the traditional NPW criterion is used, the decision is not to undertake the investment today, as it has a negative NPW of $6.74 million:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(12%) = -$50M + $12M(P/A, 12%, 5)<br /> = -$6.74M</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Real-Options Approach:</strong> Is there value to waiting two years? From an options approach, the investment will be treated as an opportunity to wait and then to undertake the investment two years later if events are favorable. As shown in Figure 13.23, this delay option can be viewed as a call option. If the value V of the project is greater than the investment cost I two years from now, then the option to undertake the project should be exercised. If not, it expires worthless. Therefore,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Delay option = max[<span class="tex-text">\(V_{2}\)</span> &#8211; <span class="tex-text">\(I_{2}\)</span>, 0]</p>
 <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(V_{2}\)</span> is a random variable that is dependent upon market demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, assume that one can use the Black–Scholes formula<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span> to value the opportunity to undertake this investment in year 2. The opportunity to wait can be considered as a European call option on the present value of the future cash flows, <span class="tex-text">\(V_{0} = \$34.49\)</span> million, with an exercise price of <span class="tex-text">\(I\)</span> = $60.5 million expiring two years from now (T = 2). Since r = 6% and <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma\)</span> = 50%, using the Black–Scholes formula, we obtain <span class="tex-text">\(d_{1}\)</span> = -0.2715, <span class="tex-text">\(d_{2}\)</span> = -0.9786, <span class="tex-text">\(N\left(d_{1} \right)\)</span> = 0.3930, and <span class="tex-text">\(N\left(d_{2} \right)\)</span> = 0.1639. The value of the real option is therefore:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">C = ENPW = 34.49 (0.3930)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; 60.5e^{-\left(0.06\right) 2} \left(0.1639\right)\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= 13.5549 &#8211; 8.7941<br /> = $4.76<br /> Value of real-option = $4.76 &#8211; (-$6.74)<br /> = $11.50 M</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, the value of retaining the flexibility of having the delay option is worth $11.50M. The ability to wait provides a decision maker a strategic NPW of $4.76M instead of a negative NPW of $6.74M. On the one hand, if the market for the product turns out to be favorable, the company will exercise the real option in the money and undertake the investment in year 2. On the other hand, if the market two years later turns out to be unfavorable, the decision will be not to undertake the investment. In summary, you could pay up to $11.50M to have this delay option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> What exactly does the $4.76M delay value imply? Suppose the firm’s project portfolio consists of ten projects, including this golf ball project. Then if the other nine projects have a net present value of $100M, the value of the firm using standard NPW still would be $100M, because the golf ball project would not be accepted, since it has a negative NPW. If the option to invest in the golf balls is included in the valuation, then the value of the firm’s portfolio is $104.76M. Therefore, the delay option that the firm possesses is worth an additional $4.76M.</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(^{4}\)</span>One can arrive at approximately the same value with the binomial model by dividing the one-year time to maturity into sufficiently small time intervals.</p>
