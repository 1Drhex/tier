(a) We begin by drawing an FBD of the two blocks combined, shown in Figure 5-23. While it is always possible to draw individual FBDs for each mass, it is not always necessary to do so. You may use a combination of the masses when they move together, which is the situation here. In this problem, the solution will be simpler if we use an FBD for the combination of the two masses. In the current situation, since the two objects move as one, we can consider that force <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}\)</span> is applied to a combined mass of <span class="tex-text">\(m_{ T }=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right)\)</span>. In addition to <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}\)</span>, there is a combined upward normal force <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ N }_{ T }\)</span> (equal to the sum of the two individual normal forces) and a force of gravity corresponding to the combined mass.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the vertical direction, the normal force from the surface must equal the force of gravity of the combined mass since there is no acceleration in this direction. In the horizontal direction, the only force acting on the system of two blocks is the 135 N force directed to the right. We will define to the right as the positive direction, and compute the acceleration magnitude in this direction using Newtonâ€™s second law:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(a=\frac{F}{m_{ T }}=\frac{135 N }{10.00 kg }=13.5 m / s ^{2}\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now that we have computed the common acceleration of the two blocks, we draw an individual FBD for each block in Figure 5-24. Two forces are acting on block 1 in the horizontal direction: the applied force <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}\)</span> and a normal force that block 2 exerts on block 1, which we will designate <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}_{2 \rightarrow 1}\)</span> .</p>
 <p class="blog">
Our arrow notation in the subscript reminds us that this is a force exerted on block 1 by block 2. Note that in this question we have both vertical normal forces (exerted by the surface on the blocks) and horizontal normal forces (exerted by one block on the other). For block 2, we have only a single horizontal force, that exerted by block 1, <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}_{1 \rightarrow 2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By Newtonâ€™s third law, we know that the magnitudes of the horizontal forces between the blocks must be equal, but they point in opposite directions; that is, <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}_{2 \rightarrow 1}=-\vec{N}_{1 \rightarrow 2}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the blocks move together, they must have a common acceleration. In this part of the problem it is obvious that the acceleration will be to the right and a will have a positive value. Newtonâ€™s second law for block 1 can be written as the following vector equation:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ F }+\overrightarrow{ N }_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} \overrightarrow{ a }\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
If we put in the known directions for the applied force and the resultant acceleration (in the positive x-direction) we have the following, where we use F to represent the magnitude of vector <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ F }\)</span>:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F \hat{ i }+\overrightarrow{ N }_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} a \hat{ i }\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
We can solve this to obtain the force exerted by block 2 on block 1:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}_{2 \rightarrow 1}=-\left(F-m_{1} a\right) \hat{i}\)</span> (4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the acceleration obtained previously, and the numerical value for the applied force, we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}\vec{N}_{2 \rightarrow 1} &amp;=-\left(135 N -(2.00 kg )\left(13.5 m / s ^{2}\right)\right) \hat{i} \\&amp;=-(108 N ) \hat{i}\end{aligned}\)</span> (5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
As expected, our result indicates that the horizontal force exerted by block 2 on block 1 is to the left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The only force acting on block 2 in the horizontal direction is the normal force from block 1. Therefore, for block 2 we can write Newtonâ€™s second law as</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ N }_{1 \rightarrow 2}=m_{2} \overrightarrow{ a }\)</span> (6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Putting in numerical values, we obtain</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}_{1 \rightarrow 2}=(8.00 kg )\left(13.5 m / s ^{2}\right) \hat{i}=(108 N ) \hat{i}\)</span> (7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comparing results (5) and (7), we see that block 1 exerts a force of 108 N directed to the right on block 2, while block 2 exerts a force of 108 N directed to the left on block 1. We could have predicted this result from Newtonâ€™s third law.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Now we consider the situation in which we are pushing <span class="tex-text">\(m_{2}\)</span> to the left with a 135 N force. Block 2 in turn pushes block 1, and they must move together with a common acceleration. Since the total mass is unchanged and the magnitude of the applied force is the same, the acceleration of the two-mass system is still <span class="tex-text">\(13.5 m / s ^{2}\)</span>, but this time the direction of the acceleration is to the left. The normal force exerted by block 1 on block 2 can be obtained by writing Newtonâ€™s second law for mass <span class="tex-text">\(m_{1}\)</span>. The FBD for this mass is shown in Figure 5-25:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ N }_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} \overrightarrow{ a }=(2.00 kg )\left(-13.5 m / s ^{2}\right) \hat{ i }=-(27.0 N ) \hat{ i }\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The value of the force is negative, meaning that it points to the left. Note that the value is less than the normal force obtained in part (a).</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the blocks move together, they have the same acceleration in both cases. It is important to realize that we can only employ the combined mass approach when the different parts are constrained to have a common acceleration. The normal force exerted in the horizontal direction by block 1 on block 2 must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to that exerted by block 2 on block 1, as required by Newtonâ€™s third law, and that is what we found. As common sense would suggest, the magnitude of the normal force between the blocks is greater when you push the less massive block into the more massive block than vice versa. While we could have done this question using magnitudes, and invoking our understanding of the situation to assign directions, we have chosen to do this using a rigorous vector approach. When this is done, the directions come out of the solution.</p>
