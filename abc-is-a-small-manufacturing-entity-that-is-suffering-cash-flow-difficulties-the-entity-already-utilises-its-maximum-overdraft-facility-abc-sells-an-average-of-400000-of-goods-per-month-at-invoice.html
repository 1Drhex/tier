            <p class="blog">ABC is a small manufacturing entity that is suffering cash-flow difficulties. The entity already utilises its maximum overdraft facility. ABC sells an average of $400,000 of goods per month at invoice value, and customers are allowed 40 days to pay from the date of invoice. Two possible solutions to the entity’s cash-flow problems have been suggested.<br /> ● Option 1. The entity could factor its trade debts. A factor has been found who would advance ABC 75 per cent of the value of its invoices immediately on receipt of the invoices, at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum. The factor would also charge a service fee amounting to 2 per cent of the total invoices. As a result of using the factor, ABC would save administration costs estimated at $5,000 per month.<br /> ● Option 2. The entity could offer a cash discount to customers for prompt payment. It has been suggested that customers could be offered a 2 per cent discount for payments made within 10 days of invoicing.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Identify the services that may be provided by factoring entities.<br /> (b) Calculate the annual net cost (in $) of the proposed factoring agreement<br /> (c) Calculate the annualised cost (in percentage terms) of offering a cash discount to customers<br /> (d) Discuss the relative merits of the two proposals.</p>

Working capital management<br /> (a) Factoring is a method of raising finance from trade receivables, whereby invoices are sold to a factoring entity.<br /> The main services associated with entities offering this finance are:<br /> ● provision of finance, often between 75 per cent and 85 per cent of approved debts from the moment the goods or services are invoiced;<br /> ● sales ledger administration covering credit checking, invoicing and collection. In effect, the sales ledger function is outsourced;<br /> ● bad-debt insurance to cover the firm in the event of default upon an invoice or invoices;<br /> ● the provision for a confidentiality agreement to prevent the arrangement being apparent to customers and others.<br /> (b) Annual sales $400,000 × 12 = $4,800,000<br /> Annual net cost of factoring $<br /> Service fee: $4,800,000 × 2% 96,000<br /> Interest charge:<br /> ($4,800,000 × 75% × 10% × 40/365) 39,452<br /> Total annual cost 135,452<br /> Less: Administration savings ($5,000 × 12) 160,000<br /> Net cost 75,452</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) Using compound interest:<br /> V = <span class="tex-text">\(X(1 + r)^{n}\)</span>, 400 = 392<span class="tex-text">\((1+r)^{1}\)</span>, 1.0204 = 1 + r,<br /> r 2.04% for a 30 day period (40 days &#8211; 10 days)<br /> (1 + annual rate) = <span class="tex-text">\((1 + periodic rate)^{number of periods in year}\)</span><br /> (1 + annual rate) = <span class="tex-text">\((1.0204)^{12.17}\)</span> = 1.2786<br /> ∴ True cost of cash discount = 27.9%<br /> (d) The cost of offering the cash discount is high (27.9 per cent), particularly compared with the cost of a bank overdraft, and may not be the most cost-effective way of improving cash flow from trade receivables. Discounts are customary in some industries, and may have to be offered as part of the entity’s overall marketing mix. However, the impact of offering discounts is difficult to access because not all customers will take advantage of the discount. On the other hand, some customers may take the discount and the normal credit period, which then creates the problem of having to chase the customer for a relatively small amount.<br /> Factoring of debts should eliminate the need for a sales ledger department, but may lead to a loss of direct contact with the customer. Factoring will improve the certainty of the cash flows from customers. The factor will also be able to assess the credit rating of each customer. Although the image is changing, factoring has traditionally been seen as lending in the last resort.<br /> While both proposals are aimed at improving cash flow, factoring will bring immediate cash on per cent of sales, while discounts will still involve a ten-day delay before cash is received.</p>
