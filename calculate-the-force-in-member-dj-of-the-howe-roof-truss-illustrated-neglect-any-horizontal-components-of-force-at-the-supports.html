It is not possible to pass a section through DJ without cutting four members whose forces are unknown. Although three of these cut by section 2 are concurrent at J and therefore the moment equation about J could be used to obtain DE, the force in DJ cannot be obtained from the remaining two equilibrium principles. It is necessary to consider first the adjacent section 1 before analyzing section 2.<br /> The free-body diagram for section 1 is drawn and includes the reaction of 18.33 kN at A, which is previously calculated from the equilibrium of the truss as a whole. In assigning the proper directions for the forces acting on the three cut members, we see that a balance of moments about A eliminates the effects of CD and JK and clearly requires that CJ be up and to the left. A balance of moments about C eliminates the effect of the three forces concurrent at C and indicates that JK must be to the right to supply sufficient counterclockwise moment.<br /> Again it should be fairly obvious that the lower chord is under tension because of the bending tendency of the truss. Although it should also be apparent that the top chord is under compression, for purposes of illustration the force in CD will be arbitrarily assigned as tension.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By the analysis of section 1, CJ is obtained from</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\([\sum{M_{A} } =0] 0.707CJ(12) &#8211; 10(4) &#8211; 10(8) = 0 CJ = 14.14 kN C\)</span> <p class="blog">
In this equation the moment of CJ is calculated by considering its horizontal and vertical components acting at point J. Equilibrium of moments about J requires</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\([\sum{M_{J} } =0] 0.894CD(6) + 18.33(12) &#8211; 10(4) &#8211; 10(8) = 0\)</span> <p class="blog">
CD = &#8211; 18.63 kN</p>
 <p class="blog">
The moment of CD about J is calculated here by considering its two components as acting through D. The minus sign indicates that CD was assigned in the wrong direction.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Hence, CD = 18.63 kN C</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the free-body diagram of section 2, which now includes the known value of CJ, a balance of moments about G is seen to eliminate DE and JK.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\([\sum{M_{G} } =0] 12DJ + 10(16) + 10(20) &#8211; 18.33(24) &#8211; 14.14(0.707)(12) = 0\)</span> <p class="blog">
DJ = 16.67 kN T</p>
 <p class="blog">
Again the moment of CJ is determined from its components considered to be acting at J. The answer for DJ is positive, so that the assumed tensile direction is correct.<br /> An alternative approach to the entire problem is to utilize section 1 to determine CD and then use the method of joints applied at D to determine DJ.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Helpful Hints<br /> 1) There is no harm in assigning one or more of the forces in the wrong direction, as long as the calculations are consistent with the assumption.<br /> A negative answer will show the need for reversing the direction of the force.<br /> 2) If desired, the direction of CD may be changed on the free-body diagram and the algebraic sign of CD reversed in the calculations, or else the work may be left as it stands with a note stating the proper direction</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Observe that a section through members<br /> CD, DJ, and DE could be taken which would cut only three unknown members. However, since the forces in these three members are all concurrent at D, a moment equation about D would yield no information about them. The remaining two force equations would not be sufficient to solve for the three unknowns.</p>
