The various numeric summary measures can be categorized into several groups: measures of central tendency; minimum, maximum, percentiles, and quartiles; measures of variability; and measures of shape. We explain each of these in this extended example.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Measures of Central Tendency</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
There are three common measures of central tendency, all of which try to answer the basic question of which value is most “typical.” These are the mean, the median, and the mode.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The mean is the average of all values. If the data set represents a sample from some larger population, this measure is called the sample mean and is usually denoted by <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{X}\)</span> (pronounced “X-bar”). If the data set represents the entire population, it is called the population mean and is usually denoted by <span class="tex-text">\(\mu\)</span> (the Greek letter mu). This distinction is not important in this chapter, but it will become relevant in later chapters on statistical inference. In either case, the formula for the mean is given by Equation (2.1).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Formula for the Mean</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\text { Mean }=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}}{n}\)</span> (2.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here, n is the number of observations and <span class="tex-text">\(X_{i}\)</span> is the value of observation i. Equation (2.1) says to add all the observations and divide by n, the number of observations. The Σ (Greek capital sigma) symbol means to sum from i = 1 to i = n, that is, to sum over all observations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For Excel data sets, you can calculate the mean with the AVERAGE function. This is shown for the baseball data, along with many other summary measures discussed shortly, in Figure 2.10. Specifically, the average salary for all players is $4,512,768. Is this a “typical” salary? Keep reading.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The median is the middle observation when the data are sorted from smallest to largest. If the number of observations is odd, the median is literally the middle observation. For example, if there are nine observations, the median is the fifth smallest (or fifth largest). If the number of observations is even, the median is usually defined as the average of the two middle observations, although there are some slight variations of this definition. For example, if there are 10 observations, the median is usually defined as the average of the fifth and sixth smallest values.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The median can be calculated in Excel with the MEDIAN function. Figure 2.10 shows that the median salary is $1,450,000. In words, half of the players make less than this, and half make more. Why is the median in this example so much smaller than the mean, and which is more appropriate? These are relevant questions for many real-world data sets. In this case, the vast majority of baseball players have relatively modest salaries that are dwarfed by the huge salaries of a few stars. Because it is an average, the mean is strongly influenced by these really large values, so it is quite large. In contrast, the median is completely unaffected by the magnitude of the really large salaries, so it is much smaller. (For example, the median would not change by a single cent if the highest paid player made $34 billion instead of his $34 million, but the mean would increase to more than $43 million.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For highly skewed data, the median is typically a better measure of central tendency. The median is unaffected by the extreme values, whereas the mean can be very sensitive to extreme values.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In many situations like this, where the data are skewed to the right (a few extremely large salaries not balanced by any extremely small salaries), most people would argue that the median is a more representative measure of central tendency than the mean. However, for variables that are not skewed in one direction or the other, the mean and median are often quite close to one another.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The mode is the value that appears most often, and it can be calculated in Excel with the MODE function. In most cases where a variable is essentially continuous, the mode is not very interesting because it is often the result of a few lucky ties. However, the mode for the salary data in Figure 2.10 is not the result of luck. Its value, $545,000, is the minimum possible salary set by the league. As shown in cell C4 (with a COUNTIF formula), this value occurred 44 times. In other words, close to 5% of the players earn the minimum possible salary. This is a good example of learning something you might not have known simply by exploring the data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Minimum, Maximum, Percentiles, and Quartiles</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Given a certain percentage such as 25%, what is the salary value such that this percentage of salaries is below it? This type of question leads to percentiles and quartiles. Specifically, for any percentage p, the pth percentile is the value such that a percentage p of all values are less than or equal to it. Similarly, the first, second, and third quartiles are the percentiles corresponding to p = 25%, p = 50%, and p = 75%. These three values divide the data into four groups, each with (approximately) a quarter of all observations. Note that the second quartile is equal to the median by definition. To complete this group of descriptive measures, we add the minimum and maximum values, with the obvious meanings.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You are probably aware of percentiles from standardized tests. For example, if you learn that your score in the verbal SAT test is at the 93rd percentile, this means that you scored better than 93% of those taking the test.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The minimum and maximum can be calculated with Excel’s MIN and MAX functions. For the percentiles and quartiles, you can use Excel’s PERCENTILE and QUARTILE functions. The PERCENTILE function takes two arguments: the data range and a value of p between 0 and 1. (It has to be between 0 and 1. For example, if you want the 95th percentile, you must enter the second argument as 0.95, not as 95.) The QUARTILE function also takes two arguments: the data range and 1, 2, or 3, depending on which quartile you want. Figure 2.10 shows the minimum, maximum, the three quartiles, and several commonly requested percentiles for the baseball data. As you can see, 25% of the players make no more than $557,471 (very close to the league minimum) and 25% of all players make more than $6,000,000. In fact, more than 1% of the players make more than $27 million, with Mike Trout topping the list at about $34 million.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you are given a salary figure such as $1 million, you might want to find the percentage of all salaries less than or equal to this. This is essentially the opposite of a percentile question. In a percentile question, you are given a percentage and you want to find a value. Now you are given a value and you want to find a percentage. You can find this percentage in Excel by dividing a COUNTIF function by the total number of observations. A few such values are shown in the bottom right of Figure 2.10. The typical formula in cell F14, which is then copied down, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
=COUNTIF(‘Salaries 2018’!$D$2:$D$878,”&lt;=”&amp;E14)/COUNT(‘Salaries 2018’!$D$2:$D$878)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The following Excel tip explains this formula in more detail.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Measures of Variability</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In this subsection, we list a few other measures that summarize variability, that is, how much the data values are spread out. These include the range, the interquartile range, the variance and standard deviation, and the mean absolute deviation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The range is a crude measure of variability. It is defined as the maximum value minus the minimum value. For the baseball salaries, this range is $33,538,333. This value certainly indicates how spread out the salaries are, but it is too sensitive to the extremes. For example, if Mike Trout’s salary increased by $10 million, the range would increase by $10 million—just because of one player.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A less sensitive measure is the interquartile range (abbreviated IQR). It is defined as the third quartile minus the first quartile, so it is really the range of the middle 50% of the data. For the baseball data, the IQR is $5,442,529. If you excluded the 25% of players with the lowest salaries and the 25% with the highest salaries, this IQR would be the range of the remaining salaries.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The range or a modified range such as the IQR probably seems like a natural measure of variability, but there is another measure that is quoted much more frequently: standard deviation. Actually, there are two related measures, variance and standard deviation, and we begin with a definition of variance. The variance is essentially the average of the squared deviations from the mean, where if <span class="tex-text">\(X_{i}\)</span> is a typical observation, its squared deviation from the mean is <span class="tex-text">\(\left(X_{i}-\text { mean }\right)^{2}\)</span>. As in the discussion of the mean, there is a sample variance, usually denoted by <span class="tex-text">\(s^{2}\)</span>, and a population variance, usually denoted by <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span> (where <span class="tex-text">\(\sigma\)</span> is the Greek letter sigma). They are defined as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Formula for Sample Variance</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(s^{2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-\text { mean }\right)^{2}}{n-1}\)</span> (2.2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Formula for Population Variance</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sigma^{2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-\text { mean }\right)^{2}}{n}\)</span> (2.3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
To understand why the variance is indeed a measure of variability, look closely at either formula. If all observations are close to the mean, their squared deviations from the mean will be relatively small, and the variance will be relatively small. On the other hand, if at least a few of the observations are far from the mean, their squared deviations from the mean will be large, and this will cause the variance to be large. Note that because deviations from the mean are squared, an observation a certain amount below the mean contributes the same to variance as an observation that same amount above the mean.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The fundamental problem with variance as a measure of variability is that it is in squared units. For example, if the observations are measured in dollars, the variance is in squared dollars. A more natural measure is the square root of variance. This is called the standard deviation. Again, there are two versions of standard deviation. The sample standard deviation, usually denoted by s, is the square root of the quantity in Equation (2.2). The population standard deviation, usually denoted by s, is the square root of the quantity in Equation (2.3).</p>
 <p class="blog">
To calculate either standard deviation in Excel, you can first find the variance with the VAR.S or VAR.P function and then take its square root. Alternatively, you can find it directly with the STDEV.S (sample) or STDEV.P (population) function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We used these functions, actually the sample versions, in cells F4 and F5 of Figure 2.10 for the baseball salaries. The huge value for variance is in dollars squared, whereas the standard deviation is in dollars, about $6.233 million. By the way, you might argue that the population versions of these parameters should be used instead, and you would have a point. After all, the data set includes all 2018 baseball players. However, you can check that with 877 players, the difference between the sample and population measures is negligible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The data in Figure 2.11 help clarify these concepts. It is in the file Variability.xlsx. (It will help if you open this file and look at its formulas as you read this.) The variable Diameter1 on the left has relatively low variability; its 10 values vary closely around its mean of approximately 100, found in cell A16 with the AVERAGE function. To show how variance is calculated, we explicitly calculated the 10 squared deviations from the mean in column B. Then either variance, sample or population, can be calculated (in cells A19 and A22) as the sum of squared deviations divided by 9 or 10. Alternatively, they can be calculated more directly (in cells B19 and B22) with Excel’s VAR.S and VAR.P functions. Next, either standard deviation, sample or population, can be calculated as the square root of the corresponding variance or with Excel’s STDEV.S or STDEV.P functions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The calculations are exactly the same for Diameter2 on the right. This variable also has mean approximately equal to 100, but its observations vary much more around 100 than the observations for Diameter1. As expected, this increased variability is obvious in a comparison of the variances and standard deviations for the two suppliers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This example also indicates why variability is important. Imagine that you are about to buy 10 parts from one of two suppliers, and you want each part’s diameter to be close to 100 centimeters. Furthermore, suppose that Diameter1 in the example represents 10 randomly selected parts from supplier 1, whereas Diameter2 represents 10 randomly selected parts from Supplier 2. You can see that both suppliers are very close to the target of 100 on average, but the increased</p>
 <p class="blog">
Variability is usually the enemy. Being close to a<br /> target value on average is not good enough if<br /> there is a lot of variability around the target.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Empirical Rules for Interpreting Standard Deviation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Now you know how to calculate the standard deviation, but there is a more important question: How do you interpret its value? Fortunately, the standard deviation often has a very natural interpretation, which is why it is quoted so frequently. This interpretation can be stated as three empirical rules. (“Empirical” means that they are based on commonly observed data, as opposed to theoretical mathematical arguments.) Specifically, if the values of this variable are approximately normally distributed (symmetric and bell-shaped), then the following rules hold:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Approximately 68% of the observations are within one standard deviation of the mean, that is, within the interval <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{X} \pm s\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
• Approximately 99.7% of the observations—almost all of them—are within three standard deviations of the mean, that is, within the interval <span class="tex-text">\(\bar{X} \pm 3s\)</span>.</p>

Fortunately, many variables in real-world data are approximately normally distributed, so these empirical rules correctly apply. (The normal distribution is discussed in depth in Chapter 5.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
These empirical rules give a concrete meaning<br /> to standard deviation for symmetric, bell-shaped distributions. However, they tend to be less accurate for skewed distributions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As an example, if the parts supplied by the suppliers in Figure 2.11 have diameters that are approximately normally distributed, then the intervals in the empirical rules for supplier 1 are about <span class="tex-text">\(100 \pm 3,100 \pm 6, \text { and } 100 \pm 9\)</span>. Therefore, about 68% of this supplier’s parts will have diameters from 97 to 103, 95% will have diameters from 94 to 106, and almost none will have diameters below 91 or above 109. Obviously, the situation for supplier 2 is much worse. With a standard deviation slightly larger than 25, the second empirical rule implies that about 1 out of every 20 of this supplier’s parts will be below 50 or above 150. It is clear that supplier 2 has to reduce its variability. In fact, this is exactly what almost all suppliers are continuously trying to do: reduce variability.</p>

Returning to the baseball data, Figure 2.10 indicates that the standard deviation of salaries is about $6.233 million. (The variance is shown, but because it is in squared dollars, it is a huge value with no meaningful interpretation.) Can the empirical rules be applied to these baseball salaries? The answer is that you can always try, but if the salaries are not at least approximately normally distributed, the rules won’t be very accurate. And because of obvious skewness in the salary data, due to the stars with huge salaries, the assumption of a normal distribution is not a good one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Nevertheless, the rules are checked in Figure 2.12. For each of the three rules, the lower and upper endpoints of the corresponding interval are found in columns I and J. Right away there are problems. Because the standard deviation is larger than the mean, all three lower endpoints are negative, which automatically means that there can be no salaries below them. But continuing anyway, the COUNTIF was used, again with concatenation, to find the number of salaries above the upper endpoints in column L, and the corresponding percentages appear in column N. Finally, subtracting columns M and N from 100% in column O gives the percentages between the endpoints. These three percentages, according to the empirical rules, should be about 68%, 95%, and 99.7%. Rules 2 and 3 are not way off, but rule 1 isn’t even close.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The point of these calculations is that even though the empirical rules give substantive meaning to the standard deviation for many variables, they should be applied with caution, especially when the data are clearly skewed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before leaving variance and standard deviation, you might ask why the deviations from the mean are squared in the definition of variance. Why not simply take absolute deviations from the mean? For example, if the mean is 100 and two observations have values 95 and 105, then each has a squared deviation of 25, but each has an absolute deviation of only 5. Wouldn’t this latter value be a more natural measure of variability? Intuitively, it would, but there is a long history of using squared deviations. They have many attractive theoretical properties that are not shared by absolute deviations. Still, some analysts quote the mean absolute deviation (abbreviated as MAD) as another measure of variability, particularly in time series analysis. It is defined as the average of the absolute deviations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Don&#8217;t be surprised if the empirical rules don&#8217;t hold for skewed data. The rules are based on the normal distribution, which is symmetric and bell-shaped.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Formula for Mean Absolute Deviation</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(MAD =\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mid X_{i}-\text { mean } \mid}{n}\)</span> (2.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is another empirical rule for MAD: For many (but not all) variables, the standard deviation is approximately 25% larger than MAD, that is, <span class="tex-text">\(s \approx 1.25^{*} MAD\)</span>. Fortunately, Excel has a function, AVEDEV, that performs the calculation in Equation (2.4). Using it for the baseball salaries in Figure 2.10, you can see that MAD is about $4.553 million. If this is multiplied by 1.25, the result is slightly over $5.69 million, which is not too far from the standard deviation.</p>

<strong>Measures of Shape</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
There are two final measures of a distribution you will hear occasionally: skewness and kurtosis. Each of these has not only an intuitive meaning but also a specific numeric measure. We have already mentioned skewness in terms of the baseball salaries. It occurs when there is a lack of symmetry. A few stars have really large salaries, and no players have really small salaries. More specifically, the largest salaries are much farther to the right of the mean than the smallest salaries are to the left of the mean. This lack of symmetry is usually apparent from a histogram of the salaries, discussed in the next section. We say that these salaries are skewed to the right (or positively skewed) because the skewness is due to the really large salaries. If the skewness were due to really small values, as might occur with temperature lows in Antarctica, then we would call it skewness to the left (or negatively skewed).</p>
 <p class="blog">
In either case, a measure of skewness can be calculated with Excel’s SKEW function. For the baseball data, it is approximately 2.1, as shown in Figure 2.10. You don’t need to know exactly what this value means. Simply remember that (1) it is positive when there is skewness to the right, (2) it is negative when there is skewness to the left, (3) it is approximately zero when the data are symmetric, and (4) its magnitude increases as the degree of skewness increases.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The other measure, kurtosis, has to do with the “fatness” of the tails of the distribution relative to the tails of a normal distribution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Remember from the third empirical rule that a normal distribution has almost all of its observations within three standard deviations of the mean. In contrast, a distribution with high kurtosis has many more extreme observations. In reality, this is much more important than you might imagine. For example, many researchers believe the Wall Street meltdown in late 2008 was at least partly due to financial analysts relying on the normal distribution, whereas in reality the actual distribution had much fatter tails. More specifically, financial analysts followed complex mathematical models that indicated really extreme events would virtually never occur. Unfortunately, a number of extreme events did occur, and they sent the economy into a deep recession.<span class="tex-text">\({ }^{1}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Although kurtosis can be calculated in Excel with the KURT function (it is about 4.1 for the baseball salaries), we won’t have any use for this measure in the book. Nevertheless, when you hear the word kurtosis, think of fat tails and extreme events. And if you plan to work on Wall Street, you should definitely learn more about kurtosis.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Numeric Summary Measures in the Status Bar</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
You might have noticed that summary measures sometimes appear automatically in the status bar at the bottom of your Excel window. The rule is that if you select multiple cells (in a single column or even in multiple columns), selected summary measures appear for the selected cells. (Nothing appears if only a single cell is selected.) These can be very handy for quick lookups. Also, you can choose the summary measures that appear by right-clicking the status bar and selecting your favorites.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Kurtosis is all about extreme events—the kind that occurred in late 2008 and sent Wall Street into a panic.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Numeric Summary Measures with Add-Ins</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
All the summary measure just discussed can be calculated with built-in Excel functions such as AVERAGE and STDEV.S. However, Excel add-ins can be used to speed up the process. Specifically, Palisade’s StatTools add-in, part of their Decision Tools Suite, is discussed in an appendix to this chapter. StatTools can generate summary measures for one or more numeric<br /> variables in seconds, and it is also capable of more advanced statistical analysis, such as regression and time series analysis, topics of later chapters.</p>
