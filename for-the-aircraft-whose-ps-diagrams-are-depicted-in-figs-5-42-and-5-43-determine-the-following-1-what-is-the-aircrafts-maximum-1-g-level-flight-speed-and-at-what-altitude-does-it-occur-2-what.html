All of the answers to these questions can be determined by looking at the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> diagrams.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) The maximum speed occurs at the point where the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> = 0 contour goes the farthest to the right. On Fig. 5.42 this is V = 1200 kn at h = 45,000 ft.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) The maximum zoom altitude is the maximum energy height line touched by the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span>=0 contour. On Fig. 5.42 this is <span class="tex-text">\(H_{e}=h_{\text {zoom }}=110,000 ft\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) The best rate of climb at sea level occurs where <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> is maximum. On Fig. 5.42 this is at approximately 530 kn at sea level, and the maximum rate of climb is greater than 800 ft/s or 48,000 ft/min.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) The minimum level-flight speed at sea level is depicted on Fig. 5.42 as the aerodynamic limit line, which means the minimum speed is limited by stall, buffet, or maximum usable angle of attack. The speed depicted on Fig. 5.42 is approximately 120 kn.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) The maximum level-flight speed at sea level is depicted on Fig. 5.42 as the q limit line, which means the maximum speed is limited by the maximum dynamic pressure that the aircraft structure can sustain. The speed depicted on Fig. 5.42 is 800 kn. In reality, this limit could be caused by engine inlet limitations, aircraft skin temperature limits, or even just the fact that the aircraft has not been flight tested beyond this limit. When test pilots &#8220;push the edge of the envelope,&#8221; they are demonstrating that the aircraft is safe to fly in areas of the flight envelope that are achievable but have not been demonstrated yet. Note that the q limit in Fig. 5.42 is identified by a maximum allowable calibrated airspeed, a performance measurement easily monitored by the pilot.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) The maximum altitude at which this aircraft can sustain n = 5 is the highest point on the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> = 0 contour on Fig. 5.43. This point is at h = 32,000 ft and V = 670 kn</p>
 <p class="blog">
7) The maximum speed at which this aircraft can sustain n = 5 is the farthest right point on the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> = 0 contour on Fig. 5.43. This point is at h = 17,000 ft and V = 820 kn. Insufficient thrust prevents sustaining 5 g at a higher speed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8) The minimum speed at which this aircraft can sustain n = 5 is the farthest left point on the <span class="tex-text">\(P_{s}\)</span> = 0 contour on Fig. 5.43. This point is at h = 0 ft and V = 330 kn. This speed is limited by stall, buffet, or maximum usable angle of attack.</p>
