Resolve the velocity of snail 2 into a component pointing towards snail 1 and a component perpendicular to this (see Fig. Sl.l). These two snails approach each other at a relative speed of <span class="tex-text">\( v +\frac{1}{2} v =\frac{3}{2} v =7.5 \ cm \ min^{-1} \)</span>, and therefore they meet after a time given by <span class="tex-text">\( 60 cm/7.5 cm min^{-1} = 8 min \)</span> . In fact, they must all meet after this time and, as they actually travel at a speed of <span class="tex-text">\( 5 cm min^{-1} \)</span>, they each cover a distance of 40 cm before doing so.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The same result can be obtained if the velocity vector of one of the snails is resolved as shown in Fig. Sl.2 into a component pointing towards the centre of the triangle formed by the snails, and a component perpendicular to this. This shows that the snails approach the centre of the triangle (it is obvious that this is where they meet) at constant speed<span class="tex-text">\( (\sqrt{3}/2 ) v =(5\sqrt{3}/2 ) \ cm \ min^{-1} \)</span>, whilst travelling around this point at a tangential speed of <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{2} v \)</span> .</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is easy to show that the snails are initially at a distance of <span class="tex-text">\( 60(\sqrt{3}/3 ) \ cm \)</span> from the centre of the triangle, and that therefore they meet in</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{60(\sqrt{3}/3 ) \ cm}{5(\sqrt{3}/2 ) \ cm \ min^{-1}} =8 \ min. \)</span> <p class="blog">
Because of the geometrical symmetry of the situation, each snail always moves so that its direction of motion makes an angle of <span class="tex-text">\( π/6 \)</span> with the line joining its current position to the centre of the triangle. However, it is worth generalising the problem of calculating the trajectory. Consider the motion of a body moving at constant speed <span class="tex-text">\( v \)</span> around a fixed point with the angle between the velocity and position vectors equal to a fixed value<span class="tex-text">\( α , \ (0&lt;α&lt;90°)\)</span>. If the position vector, of initial length <span class="tex-text">\(r_0 \)</span> , moves through a small angle <span class="tex-text">\( Δ \phi \)</span> and its length changes by <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; Δ r\)</span> (see Fig. Sl.3), then, since <span class="tex-text">\(α \)</span> remains constant,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{\Delta r(\phi )}{\Delta \phi } =-r(\phi )\cot \alpha \)</span> <p class="blog">
This equation is very similar to the radioactive decay equation, <span class="tex-text">\( dm(t)/dt=-m(t)\lambda \)</span> , the known solution of which is <span class="tex-text">\( m(t)=m_0e^{-\lambda \ t} \)</span>. Using this analogy, the equation of a snail&#8217;s path (in polar coordinates) is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( r(\phi )=r_0e^{-\phi \ \cot \alpha }\alpha \)</span> .</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is the equation of the so-called logarithmic spiral and implies that the radius r tends to zero only after turning through an infinite angle, i.e. a point-like body reaches the centre in finite time and by covering a finite distance, but only after making an infinite number of turns about the centre.<br /> <em>Note</em>. Nocturnal insects try to follow straight flight paths by keeping a constant bearing with respect to a distant light source (e.g. the Moon). If a nearby lamp misleads them, then, according to the solution just found, they will follow a spiral path to disaster. As neither the insects nor the lamp are point-like, sooner or later the insects hit the lamp.</p>
