            <p class="blog">Producing and Shipping Tomato Products at RedBrand</p> <p class="blog">The RedBrand Company produces a tomato product at three plants. This product can be shipped directly to the company’s two customers or it can first be shipped to the company’s two warehouses and then to the customers. Figure 5.19 is a network representation of RedBrand’s problem. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 represent the plants (these are the origins, denoted by S for supplier), nodes 4 and 5 represent the warehouses (these are the transshipment points, denoted by T), and nodes 6 and 7 represent the customers (these are the destinations, denoted by D). Note that some shipments are allowed among plants, among warehouses, and among customers. Also, some arcs have arrows on both ends. This means that flow is allowed in either direction.</p> <p class="blog">The cost of producing the product is the same at each plant, so RedBrand is concerned with minimizing the total shipping cost incurred in meeting customer demands. The production capacity of each plant (in tons per year) and the demand of each customer are shown in Figure 5.19. For example, plant 1 (node 1) has a capacity of 200, and customer 1 (node 6) has a demand of 400. In addition, the cost (in thousands of dollars) of shipping a ton of the product between each pair of locations is listed in Table 5.5, where a blank indicates that RedBrand cannot ship along that arc. We also assume that at most 200 tons of the product can be shipped between any two nodes. This is the common arc capacity. RedBrand wants to determine a minimum-cost shipping schedule.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To find the minimum-cost way to ship the tomato product from suppliers to customers, possibly through warehouses, so that customer demands are met and supplier capacities are not exceeded.</p> <p class="blog">Table 5.5 Shipping Costs for RedBrand Example (in $1000s):</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 650px; height: 229px;" border="0" width="576" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">7</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">6</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">5</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">4</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">3</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">2</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">1</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">From node</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">20.0</td> <td dir="LTR">20.0</td> <td dir="LTR">5.0</td> <td dir="LTR">5.0</td> <td dir="LTR">3.0</td> <td dir="LTR">5.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">1</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">15.0</td> <td dir="LTR">8.0</td> <td dir="LTR">1.0</td> <td dir="LTR">1.0</td> <td dir="LTR">9.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">9.0</td> <td dir="LTR">2</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">12.0</td> <td dir="LTR">10.0</td> <td dir="LTR">0.5</td> <td dir="LTR">1.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">8.0</td> <td dir="LTR">4.0</td> <td dir="LTR">3</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">12.0</td> <td dir="LTR">2.0</td> <td dir="LTR">1.2</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">4</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">12.0</td> <td dir="LTR">2.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">0.8</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">5</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">1.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">6</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19"></td> <td dir="LTR">7.0</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">7</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The network configuration itself would come from geographical considerations—which routes are physically possible (or sensible) and which are not.

The variables and constraints for RedBrand’s model are shown in Figure 5.20. (See the file RedBrand Logistics Big Picture.xlsx.) Again, you see the strong resemblance between this “big picture” and the previous big pictures in this chapter. The key to the model is handling the flow balance constraints. You will see exactly how to implement these when we give step-by-step instructions for developing the spreadsheet model. However, it is not enough, say, to specify that the flow out of plant 2 is less than or equal to the capacity of plant 2. The reason is that there might also be flow into plant 2 (from another plant). Therefore, the correct flow balance constraint for plant 2 is that the flow out of it must be less than or equal to its capacity plus any flow into it. Equivalently, the net outflow from plant 2 must be less than or equal to its capacity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> To set up the spreadsheet model, proceed as follows. (See Figure 5.21 and the file RedBrand Logistics Finished.xlsx. Also, refer to the network in Figure 5.19.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Origins and destinations. Enter the node numbers (1 to 7) for the origins and destinations of the various arcs in the range A8:B33. Note that the disallowed arcs are not entered in this list. Also, note that some pairs of rows, such as rows 8 and 14, correspond to two-way arrows, with possibly different unit costs.<br /> 2) Input data. Enter the unit shipping costs (in thousands of dollars), the common arc capacity, the plant capacities, and the customer demands in the blue cells. Again, only the nonblank entries in Table 5.5 are used to fill the column of unit shipping costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Flows on arcs. Enter any initial values for the flows in the range D8:D33. These are the decision variable cells.<br /> 4 Arc capacities. To indicate a common arc capacity for all arcs, enter the formula<br /> =$B$4<br /> in cell F8 and copy it down column F.<br /> 5) Flow balance constraints. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are supply nodes, nodes 4 and 5 are transshipment points, and nodes 6 and 7 are demand nodes. Therefore, set up the left sides of the flow balance constraints appropriately for these three cases. Specifically, enter the net outflow for node 1 in cell I9 with the formula<br /> =SUMIF(Origin,H9,Flow)-SUMIF(Destination,H9,Flow)<br /> and copy it down to cell I11. This formula subtracts flows into node 1 from flows out of node 1 to obtain net outflow for node 1. Next, copy this same formula to cells I15 and I16 for the warehouses. (Remember that, for transshipment nodes, the left side of the constraint can be net outflow or net inflow, whichever you prefer. The reason is that if net outflow is zero, net inflow must also be zero.) Finally, enter the net inflow for node 6 in cell I20 with the formula<br /> =SUMIF(Destination,H20,Flow)-SUMIF(Origin,H20,Flow)<br /> and copy it to cell I21. This formula subtracts flows out of node 6 from flows into node 6 to obtain the net inflow for node 6.</p>

<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box should be set up as in Figure 5.22. The objective is to minimize total shipping costs, subject to the three types of flow balance constraints and the arc capacity constraints. 6 Total shipping cost. Calculate the total shipping cost (in thousands of dollars) in cell B36 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Unit_cost,Flow)</p>

<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box should be set up as in Figure 5.22. The objective is to minimize total shipping costs, subject to the three types of flow balance constraints and the arc capacity constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution in Figure 5.21 indicates that RedBrand’s customer demand can be satisfied with a shipping cost of $3,260,000. This solution appears graphically in Figure 5.23. Note in particular that plant 1 produces 180 tons (under capacity) and ships it all to plant 3, not directly to warehouses or customers. Also, note that all shipments from the warehouses go directly to customer 1. Then customer 1 ships 180 tons to customer 2. We purposely chose unit shipping costs (probably unrealistic ones) to produce this type of behavior, just to show that it can occur. As you can see, the costs of shipping from plant 1 directly to warehouses or customers are relatively large compared to the cost of shipping directly to plant 3. Similarly, the costs of shipping from plants or warehouses directly to customer 2 are prohibitive. Therefore, RedBrand ships to customer 1 and lets customer 1 forward some of its shipment to customer 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> How much effect does the arc capacity have on the optimal solution? Currently, three of the arcs with positive flow are at the arc capacity of 200. You can use SolverTable to see how sensitive this number and the total cost are to the arc capacity<span class="tex-text">\(.^{4}\)</span> In this case the single input cell for SolverTable is cell B4, which is varied from 150 to 300 in increments of 25. Two quantities are designated as outputs: total cost and the number of arcs at arc capacity. As before, if you want to keep track of an output that does not already exist, you can create it with an appropriate formula in a new cell before running SolverTable. Specifically, you can enter the formula =COUNTIF(Flow,B4) in an unused cell. This formula counts the arcs with flow equal to arc capacity. (See the finished version of the file for a note about this formula.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function</strong>: COUNTIF<br /> The COUNTIF function counts the number of values in a given range that satisfy some criterion.The syntax is 5COUNTIF(range,criterion). For example, the formula 5COUNTIF(D8:D33,150) counts the number of cells in the range D8:D33 that contain the value 150. This formula could also be entered as =COUNTIF(D8:D33,&#8221;=150&#8243;). Similarly, the formula =COUNTIF(D8:D33,&#8221;&gt;=100&#8243;) counts the number of cells in this range with values greater than or equal to 100<span class="tex-text">\(.^{5}\)</span><br /> The SolverTable output in Figure 5.24 is what you would expect. As the arc capacity decreases, more flows bump up against it, and the total cost increases. But even when the arc capacity is increased to 300, two flows are constrained by it. In this sense, even this large an arc capacity costs the company money.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Variations of the Model</strong><br /> There are many variations of the RedBrand shipping problem that can be handled by a network model. We briefly consider two possible variations. First, suppose that RedBrand ships two products along the given network. We assume that the unit shipping costs are the same for both products (although this assumption could easily be relaxed), but the common arc capacity, which has been changed to 300, represents the maximum flow of both products that can flow on any arc. In this sense, the two products are competing for arc capacity. Each plant has a separate production capacity for each product, and each customer has a separate demand for each product.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The spreadsheet model for this variation appears in Figure 5.25. (See the file RedBrand Logistics Multiple Products Finished.xlsx.) Very little in the original model needs to be changed. You need to (1) have two columns of decision variable cells (columns D and E), (2) apply the previous logic to both products separately in the flow balance constraints, and (3) apply the arc capacities to the total flows in column F (which are the sums of flows in columns D and E). The modified Solver dialog box, not shown here, is the same as before. The reason is that we have range-named blocks of cells for the flow balance constraints. For example, the ranges K9:L11 and N9:O11 are named Plant_net_outflow and Plant_capacity. These entire blocks can then be used to specify the capacity constraints for both products with the single entry Plant_net_outflow &lt;=5 Plant_capacity in the Solver dialog box. This is another example of planning the spreadsheet layout so that the resulting model is as efficient and readable as possible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A second variation of the model is appropriate for perishable goods, such as fruit. (See the file RedBrand Logistics Shrinkage Finished.xlsx.) We again assume that there is a single product, but some percentage of the product that is shipped to warehouses perishes and cannot be sent to customers. This means that the total inflow to a warehouse is greater than the total outflow from the warehouse. This behavior can be modeled as shown in Figure 5.26. The corresponding Solver dialog box, not shown here, is the same as in the original RedBrand model. The shrinkage factor in cell B5, the percentage that does not spoil in the warehouses, becomes a new input. It is then incorporated into the warehouse flow balance constraints by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIF(Origin,H16,Flow)-$B$5*SUMIF(Destination,H16,Flow)<br /> in cell I16 and copying to cell I17. This formula says that what goes out (the first term) is 90% of what goes in. The other 10% perishes. Of course, shrinkage results in a larger total cost—about 20% larger—than in the original RedBrand model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Interestingly, however, some units are still sent to both warehouses, and the entire capacity of all plants is now used. Finally, you can check that a feasible solution exists even for a shrinkage factor of 0% (where everything sent to warehouses disappears). As you might guess, the solution then is to send everything directly from plants to customers—at a steep cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. Excel’s Solver uses the simplex method to solve logistics models. However, the simplex method can be simplified dramatically for these types of models. The simplified version of the simplex method, called the network simplex method, is much more efficient than the ordinary simplex method. Specialized computer codes have been written to implement the network simplex method, and all large logistics problems are solved by using the network simplex method. This is fortunate because real logistics models tend to be extremely large. See Winston (2003) for a discussion of this method.<br /> 2. If the given supplies and demands for the nodes are integers and all arc capacities are integers, the logistics model always has an optimal solution with all integer flows. Again, this is very fortunate for large problems—you get integer solutions “for free” without having to use an integer programming algorithm. Note, however, that this “integers for free” benefit is guaranteed only for the basic logistics model, as in the original RedBrand model. When the model is modified in certain ways, such as by adding a shrinkage factor, the optimal solution is no longer guaranteed to be integer-valued.</p>

4:Note that Solver’s sensitivity report would not answer our question. This report is useful only for one-at-a-time changes in inputs, and here we are simultaneously changing the upper limit for each flow. However, this report (its bottom section) can be used to assess the effects of changes in plant capacities or customer demands.<br /> 5:The COUNTIF and SUMIF functions are limited in that they allow only one condition, such as “&gt;=10”. For this reason, Microsoft added two new functions in Excel 2007, COUNTIFS and SUMIFS, that allow multiple conditions. You can learn about them in online help.</p>
