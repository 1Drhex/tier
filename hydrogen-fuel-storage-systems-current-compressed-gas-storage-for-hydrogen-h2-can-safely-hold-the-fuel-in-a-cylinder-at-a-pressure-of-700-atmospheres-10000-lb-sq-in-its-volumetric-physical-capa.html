            <p class="blog"><strong>Hydrogen Fuel Storage Systems</strong></p> <p class="blog">Current compressed-gas storage for hydrogen (<span class="tex-text">\(H_{2}\)</span>) can safely hold the fuel in a cylinder at a pressure of 700 atmospheres (10,000 lb./sq.in.). Its volumetric physical capacity of 0.0225 kg of <span class="tex-text">\(H_{2}\)</span> per liter of storage unit space corresponds to a volumetric energy capacity of 0.0225 × 33.33 = 0.75 kWh per liter. Its gravimetric physical capacity, or <em>weight ratio</em>, of 3.5 percent (hydrogen weight to total system weight) corresponds to a gravimetric energy capacity of 0.035 × 33.33 = 1.17 kWh/kg. The capacity cost of a 700-atmosphere system is $16 per kWh. Assume that the hydrogen storage system can discharge 98.6 percent of its contents (the remainder being residual pressure in the tank when it is <em>empty</em>). Assume also that it has a useful life of 10 years, driven by calendar time, not by usage, and limited by the life of the vehicle as a whole. Create a spreadsheet model that answers the following questions about the hydrogen storage system.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Current electric vehicles have an efficiency of approximately 3.5 miles/kWh. What capacity of electric energy storage system (in kWh) would be needed to drive 300 miles?<br /> (b) How large in volume would the storage system have to be? Compare that to a 20-gallon fuel tank in an ICE.<br /> (c) How much would the storage system add to the weight of an electric vehicle? How does that compare to the battery in a Nissan Leaf ()?<br /> (d) How much would the hydrogen storage system cost?<br /> (e) Assume a typical personal discount rate of 6 percent per year. What is the levelized cost of the storage system over its useful life?<br /> (f) For a user who drives 12,000 miles per year, what is the AFC of the storage system, expressed in $ per kWh delivered to the motor?<br /> (g) For a user who drives 20,000 miles per year, what is the AFC of the storage system, expressed in $ per kWh delivered to the motor?<br /> (h) The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) goal for 2015 was to achieve a volumetric physical capacity of 0.070 to 0.075 kg <span class="tex-text">\(H_{2}\)</span> per liter of storage unit space and a weight ratio of 7.5 to 8.0 percent. Assume that such a system could be sold for eight dollars per kWh. How would that affect the AFC of the storage system?<br /> (i) The U.S. DOE’s long-term goal for hydrogen storage technology, which may have to be achieved by technologies other than compression, such as solid-state materials-based storage, is to achieve a volumetric physical capacity of 0.040 kg <span class="tex-text">\(H_{2}\)</span> per liter of storage unit space and a weight ratio of 5.5 percent. Assume that such a system could be sold for six dollars per kWh. How would that affect the AFC of the storage system?</p>

The reader should develop a spreadsheet solution using the logic presented in the following solution. Questions (g) and (h) can be answered as sensitivity analysis on the model by changing the assumptions about the gravimetric and volumetric capacities of the system.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) The storage system would need to deliver 300 (miles)/3.5 (miles/kWh) = 85.7 kWh. But the system can discharge only 98.6 percent of its contents, so the capacity needed to go 300 miles will be 85.7/98.6% = 87 kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The system would have a volume of 87 kWh/0.75 (kWh/L) = 116 liters. One gallon is 3.785 liters, so that volume would be 116/3.785 = 30.6 gal. That would be about half again as large as a 20-gal gasoline tank in an ICE vehicle.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The weight of the storage system would be 87 kWh/1.17 (kWh/kg) = 74.3 kg, which at 2.2 lb./kg corresponds to 164 lb.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) At a capacity cost of $16/kWh, the system would cost 16 × 87 = $1,391.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) The levelized cost of that system over a 10-year useful life would be given by the spreadsheet function =PMT(6%,10,–1391), which returns the answer $189.03 per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(f) A usage of 12,000 miles per year corresponds to 12,000/3.5 = 3,428.6 kWh per year. Divided into the $189.03 levelized cost, this gives an AFC of <em>$0.055 per kWh</em> of energy delivered from storage, meaning 5.5 cents per kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(g) Replacing 12,000 by 20,000 as the annual mileage in a spreadsheet solution to this problem reveals a new AFC of delivered energy, <em>$0.033</em> per kWh. Percentagewise, this is a significant decrease in the per-kWh cost, and it is due to the life of the storage system being defined by calendar time, not by usage.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(h) Under the DOE’s target for 2015, and the assumed capacity cost falling to $8/kWh, the AFC would fall to $0.028 per kWh, which is about half of the present value.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(i) Under the DOE’s long-term target, and the assumed capacity cost falling to $6/kWh, the AFC would fall to $0.021 per kWh.</p>
