            <p class="blog">Project Cash Flows for a Cost-Only Project</p> <p class="blog">Alcoa Aluminum’s McCook plant produces aluminum coils, sheets, and plates. Its annual production runs at 400 million pounds. In an effort to improve McCook’s current production system, an engineering team, led by the divisional vice-president, went on a fact-finding tour of Japanese aluminum and steel companies to observe their production systems and methods. Cited among the team’s observations were large fans which the Japanese companies used to reduce the time that coils need to cool down after various processing operations. Cooling the hot process coils with the fans was estimated to significantly reduce the queue or work-in-process (WIP) inventory buildup allowed for cooling. The approach also reduced production lead time and improved delivery performance. The possibility of reducing production time and, as a consequence, the WIP inventory, excited the team members, particularly the vice-president. After the trip, Neal Donaldson, the plant engineer, was asked to investigate the economic feasibility of installing cooling fans at the McCook plant. Neal’s job is to justify the purchase of cooling fans for his plant. He was given one week to prove that the idea was a good one. Essentially, all he knew was the number of fans, their locations, and the project cost. Everything else was left to Neal’s devices. Suppose that he compiled the following financial data:</p> <p class="blog">• The project will require an investment of <span class="tex-text">\(\$536,000\)</span> in cooling fans now.</p> <p class="blog">• The cooling fans would provide 16 years of service with no appreciable salvage values, considering the removal costs.</p> <p class="blog">• It is expected that the amount of time required between hot rolling and the next operation would be reduced from five days to two days. Cold-rolling queue time also would be reduced, from two days to one day for each cold-roll pass. The net effect of these changes would be a reduction in the WIP inventory at a value of <span class="tex-text">\(\$2,121,000\)</span>. Because of the lead time involved in installing the fans, as well as the consumption of stockpiled WIP inventory, this working-capital release will be realized one year after the fans are installed.</p> <p class="blog">• The cooling fans will be depreciated according to seven-year MACRS.</p> <p class="blog">• Annual electricity costs are estimated to rise by <span class="tex-text">\(\$86,000\)</span>.</p> <p class="blog">• The firm’s after-tax required rate of return is known to be <span class="tex-text">\(20\%\)</span> for this type of cost reduction project.</p> <p class="blog">Develop the project cash flows over the service period of the fans, and determine whether the investment is a wise one, based on <span class="tex-text">\(20\%\)</span> interest.</p>

Even with only one time savings in WIP, this cooling-fan project is economically justifiable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) If we are to justify the investment on the basis of the internal rate of return, we first need to determine whether the investment is a simple or nonsimple one. Since there are more than one sign changes in the cash flow series, this is not a simple investment, indicating the possibility of multiple rates of return. In fact, as shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 10.6\)</span>, the project has two rates of return, one at <span class="tex-text">\(4.24\%\)</span> and the other at 291.56%. Neither is a true rate of return, as we learned in Section 7.3.2, so we may proceed to abandon the rate-of-return approach and use the <span class="tex-text">\(NPW\)</span> criterion. If you desire to find the true <span class="tex-text">\(IRR\)</span> for this project, you need to follow the procedures outlined in Section 7.3.4. At a MARR of <span class="tex-text">\(20\%\)</span>, the true <span class="tex-text">\(IRR\)</span> (or return on invested capital) is <span class="tex-text">\(241.87\%\)</span>, which is significantly larger than the MARR and indicates acceptance of the investment. Note that this is the same conclusion that we reached in (b).</p>
 <p class="blog">
COMMENTS: As the cooling fans reach the end of their service lives, we need to add the working-capital investment <span class="tex-text">\((\$2,120,000)\)</span> at the end of year 16, working under the assumption that the plant will return to the former system without the cooling fans and thus will require the additional investment in working capital.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the new system has proven to be effective, and the plant will remain in service, we need to make another investment to purchase a new set of cooling fans at the end of year 16. As a consequence of this new investment, there will be a working-capital release in the amount of <span class="tex-text">\(\$2,120,000\)</span>. However, this investment should bring benefits to the second cycle of the operation, so that it should be charged against the cash flows for the second cycle, not the first cycle.</p>
