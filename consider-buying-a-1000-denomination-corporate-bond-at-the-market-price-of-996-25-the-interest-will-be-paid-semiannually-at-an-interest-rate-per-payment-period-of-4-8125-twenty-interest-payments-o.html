<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
You can trade bonds on the market just like stocks. Once you have purchased a bond, you can keep the bond until it reaches maturity or sell at any interest period before maturity. You can purchase or sell bonds at prices other than face value, depending on the economic environment, as bond prices change over time because of the risk of nonpayment of interest or face value, supply and demand, and the outlook for economic conditions. These factors affect the yield to maturity (or return on investment ). The yield to maturity represents<br /> the actual interest earned from a bond over the holding period. In other<br /> words, the yield to maturity on a bond is the interest rate that establishes the equivalence between all future interest and face-value receipts and the market price of the bond. Some specific bond terms to understand are summarized as follows:<br /> <strong>• Face (par) value:</strong> The corporate bond has a face value of $1,000.<br /> <strong>• Maturity date :</strong> The bonds that were issued on January 30, 2011, will mature on January 31, 2021; thus, they have a 10-year maturity at time of issue.<br /> <strong>• Coupon rate :</strong> The bond’s coupon rate is 9.625%, and interest is payable semiannually. For example, the bonds have a $1,000 face value, and they pay $96.25 in simple interest 1958 %2 each year (or $48.13 every six months).<br /> <strong>• Discount bond :</strong> The bonds are offered at less than the face value at 99.625%, or 0.375% discount. For example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 can be purchased for just $996.25, which is known as the market price (or value) of the bond.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We find the yield to maturity by determining the interest rate that makes the present worth of the receipts equal to the market price of the bond:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">$996.25 = $48.13(P/A, i, 20) + $1000(P/F, i, 20).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The value of i that makes the present worth of the receipts equal to $996.25 lies between 4.5% and 5%. Solving for i by interpolation yields i = 4.84% .<br /> Using the IRR function in Excel, we may easily calculate the yield to maturity, as shown in Table 7.1 . The initial guess value used in this calculation is 4% with the cell range of B10:B30.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> Note that this result is a 4.84% yield to maturity per semiannual period. The nominal (annual) yield is 2(4.84) = 9.68% compounded semiannually. When compared with the coupon rate of 9<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{5}{8}\)</span> % (or 9.625%), purchasing the bond with the price discounted at 0.375% brings about an additional 0.055% yield. The effective annual coupon rate is then</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">i<span class="tex-text">\(_{a}\)</span> = (1 + 0.0484)<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span> &#8211; 1 = 9.91%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This 9.91% represents the effective annual yield to maturity on the bond. Notice that when you purchase a bond at face value and sell at face value, the yield to maturity will be the same as the coupon rate of the bond.</p>

<strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Determine the interest rate that makes the PW of receipts equal to the bond’s market price.</p>
