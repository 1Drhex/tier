            <p class="blog">So, what could be better than winning a SuperLotto Plus jackpot? Choosing how to receive your winnings! Before playing a SuperLotto Plus jackpot, you have a choice between getting the entire jackpot in 26 annual graduated payments or receiving one lump sum that will be less than the announced jackpot. (See Figure 2.29 .) What would these choices come out to for an announced jackpot of $7 million?<br /> <strong>• Lump‐sum cash‐value option:</strong> The winner would receive the present cash value of the announced jackpot in one lump sum. In this case, the winner would receive about 49.43%, or $3.46 million, in one lump sum (less tax withholdings). This cash value is based on average market costs determined by U.S. Treasury<br /> zero‐coupon bonds with 5.3383% annual yield.<br /> <strong>• Annual‐payments option:</strong> The winner would receive the jackpot in 26 graduated annual payments. In this case, the winner would receive $175,000 as the first payment (2.5% of the total jackpot amount) immediately. The second payment would be $189,000. Over the course of the next 25 years, these payments would gradually increase each year by $7,000 to a final payment of $357,000.</p> <p class="blog">If the U.S. Treasury zero‐coupon rate is reduced to 4.5% (instead of 5.338%) at the time of winning, what would be the equivalent cash value of the lottery?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Given:</strong> <span class="tex-text">\(A_{0}\)</span> = $175,000, <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1}\)</span> = $189,000, G = $7,000 (from payment periods 2 to 25), i = 4.5% per year, and N = 25 years, as shown in Figure 2.29 .<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> P .</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/10/9-1-768x546.png"></div>

<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> This problem is identical to asking what the equivalent present worth for this annual‐payment series is at 4.5% interest.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
This method yields the following:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P = $175,000 + 189,000(P/A, 4.5%, 25) + $7,000(P/G, 4.5%, 25)<br /> = $3,990,189.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash value now has increased from $3.46 million to $3.99 million. In other words, if you check the “Cash Value” box on your lottery ticket and you win, you will receive the present cash value of the announced jackpot in one lump sum in the amount of $3.99 million.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In obtaining column C of the spreadsheet in Table 2.9 , we could get the annual cash flow amount in each year by adding $7,000 to the amount in the previous period. For example, Cell C14 is obtained by = C13 + $C$7. Then Cell C15 is obtained by = C14 + $C$7 and so on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>METHODOLOGY</strong><br /> Method 1: Compute the Equivalent Cash Value<br /> Note that the annual payment series consists of a single payment at n = 0 and a linear gradient series.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Method 2: Excel Spreadsheet<br /> Using Excel, we could reproduce the same result, as in Table 2.9 .</p>
