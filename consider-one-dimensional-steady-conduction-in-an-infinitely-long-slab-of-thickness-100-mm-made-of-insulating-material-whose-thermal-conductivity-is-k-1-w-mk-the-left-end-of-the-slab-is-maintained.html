As is evident, this is typically an inverse problem since it requires the estimation of surface the thermophysical property (emissivity) from measured temperature distribution. Generally the direct problem for such a case would be the determination of temperature distribution for given thermopysical properties such as emissivity in this case. The assumptions pertinent to the present problem are listed below:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. The slab is infinitely long and finitely thick, facilitating one dimension heat conduction along the thickness dirction only.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. The thermophysical properties for the slab are coIllitant and do not change either with temperature or location.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. The right wall loses heat to a constant temperature evacuated space only by radiation and convection currents are completely absent.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. There is no internal heat generation in the slab and temperatures are recorded at steady state.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The governing equation for the above stated problem can be written as</p>

<strong>Solution to the forward model:</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The governing equation as given by Eq.(7.3) along with the boundary conditions as specified in Eq. (7.4) and Eq. (7.5) can be discretised using second order finite differences. This would lead to a set of simultaneous linear equations in T, which then can be solved using an iterative method such as the Gauss Siedel scheme. A sample FORTRAN program for the problem is listed hereby for ready reference.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Least squares minimization can be used to solve the inverse problem by substituting different values of <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon\)</span> and solving the governing equation to obtain the temperature distribution <span class="tex-text">\(T _{i}\)</span>, where the subscript i denotes the location at which the temperature is measured. Once this is obtained, the sum of the residues is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(S(\varepsilon)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(T_{\text {exp }, i}-T_{\text {calc }, i}\right)^{2}\)</span> (7.6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The sum of the square of the residual, <span class="tex-text">\(S (\varepsilon)\)</span> is computed for 0 ranging from <span class="tex-text">\(0.15 \leq \varepsilon \leq 0.95\)</span> in steps of 0.1 and these are as shown in Table. 7.2. Figure 7.2 depicts the plot of residuals <span class="tex-text">\( S (\varepsilon)\)</span> for different values of <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon \text { . }\)</span> From Table 7.2 and Fig.7.2 one can conclude that <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon\)</span> should lie in the range <span class="tex-text">\(0.75 \leq \varepsilon \leq 0.95\)</span>.</p>

The exercise we have performed here is frequently referred to as exhaustive equal interval search. It is possible to employ faster and more sophisticated search algorithms like the Fibonacci or Golden Section search to get a much better estimate of e with same number of functional evaluations (Please refer to Balaji(2011) for further discussion of different optimization methods for single and multi variable problem.). Even with the slightly crude exhaustive search method presented above, we can fit a local Lagrangian interpolating polynomial for <span class="tex-text">\(S(\varepsilon)\)</span> by using three values of 0 where the residuals approach minimum i.e in the range <span class="tex-text">\(0.75 \leq \varepsilon \leq 0.95\)</span>.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(S(\varepsilon)=\frac{(\varepsilon-0.85)(\varepsilon-0.95)}{(0.75-0.85)(0.75-0.95)} \times 7.81\)</span> <p class="blog">

 <span class="tex-text">\(+\frac{(\varepsilon-0.75)(\varepsilon-0.95)}{(0.85-0.75)(0.85-0.95)}\times 3.01 \)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(+\frac{(\varepsilon-0.75)(\varepsilon-0.85)}{(0.95-0.75)(0.95-0.85)} \times 7.14\)</span> (7.7)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(S(\varepsilon)=1048.5 \varepsilon^{2}-1785.8 \varepsilon+757.38\)</span> (7.8)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Differentiating Eq.(7.8) to obtain <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d S(\varepsilon)}{d \varepsilon}\)</span> and equating it to zero we can make <span class="tex-text">\(S (\varepsilon)\)</span> stationary</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d S(\varepsilon)}{d \varepsilon}=2097 \varepsilon-1785.8=0\)</span> (7.9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon=0.84\)</span> (7.10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, while the exhaustive search gave the solution as <span class="tex-text">\(0.75 \leq \varepsilon \leq 0.95\)</span>, upon fine tuning this with the Lagrangian interpolation our best estimate of <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon \text { is } 0.84\)</span>.</p>

In the foregoing example, the direct or forward model was an ordinary differential equation. However, a non-linearity was present in one of the boundary conditions. Often times in thermal sciences, particularly in radiative heat transfer, the forward model would involve the solution of a partial differential equation or an integral equation and sometimes even an integra-differential equation. These are formidable to solve and invariably require numerical techniques. From the flow chart given in Fig.7.3, it is clear that any inverse problem involves repeated solution to the forward model, as invariably the forward model cannot be directly inverted. For example, there is no way by which we can write out a closed form expression for e in example 7.1 in term of temperatures and determine it rightaway. This is further compounded by the presence of noise in the measurement of temperature. The requirement of repeated solution to the forward model often makes the solution of an inverse problem time consuming.<br /> Researchers have tried to address this by developing a faster equivalent of the forward model using techniques like artificial neural networks, which are known as surrogates. From the flow chart, it is also evident that the solution to the inverse problem can often be posed as a minimisation problem and so advanced and cutting edge optimisation techniques can be made use of to improve accuracy, speed and robustness of the ever increasing challenge posed by the high dimensional inverse problems wherein several parameters need to be estimated from limited measurements.</p>
