The Spalart-Allmaras model with the matrix free C B S-A C scheme is used here to solve three-dimensional turbulent fow past a stationary circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 10000 . Both the top and bottom sides and inlet are placed at a distance of 4 times the diameter of the cylinder from the center of the cylinder. The exit of the domain is assumed at a distance of 10 times the diameter of the cylinder from the center of the cylinder. The length of the cylinder used is 0.5 times the diameter and the front and back surfaces of the domain are assumed to be symmetric (no flow). Uniform velocity conditions in the <span class="tex-text">\( x_{1}\)</span> direction are assumed at the inlet. The size of the real time step was set at 0.05 .The turbulent scalar variable (modified turbulent eddy kinematic viscosity) was assumed to be <span class="tex-text">\( 10^{-8}\)</span> at the inlet for the Spalart-Allmaras model. On the top and bottom sides, slip conditions were assumed and no turbulence quantity was prescribed. On the cylinder walls, no slip conditions were assumed and the turbulent scalar variable of the Spalart-Allmaras model was assumed to be zero. The dual time-stepping method was employed (see Section 7.7) with the matrix free C B S-A C scheme. The local time step depends on each element size within every real time step. The two different meshes used to test the flow past a three-dimensional circular cylinder problem are shown in Figure 8.10 . The fully unstructured mesh (meshI) comprises 606769 tetrahedral elements and 115035 nodes. The hybrid mesh (mesh2) consists of three structured layers close to the cylinder surface and unstructured grid away from the wall. Figure 8.10(d) shows the mesh in the vicinity of the cylinder. Both meshes are refined close to the wall and in the wake region to predict the vortex shedding. Figure 8.11 shows the time variation of the drag coefficient, lift coefficient and pressure coefficient using the unstructured and hybrid meshes. The average drag coefficient obtained is 1.311 from the unstructured mesh1. The Strouhal number is 0.152 <span class="tex-text">\( St =f L / u_{\infty}\)</span>, f is the frequency of vortex shedding). The amplitude of lift coefficient is between 1 and -1 . The averaged drag coefficient obtained by the hybrid mesh 2 is 1.239, which is more accurate than the result of mesh1 in comparison with experimental data. The Strouhal number here is around 0.144 In Figure 8.11( c ), the pressure coefficient values at Re =10000 are compared with two different turbulence procedures, one is the available LES modeling data (Lu et al., 1997 ) and another is the numerical data from non-linear eddy viscosity modeling (Lu et al., 2003 a, b). As seen, the time-averaged pressure distribution on the hybrid mesh 2 is in good agreement with LES and nonlinear models, except near the stagnation point. This may be attributed to turbulence modeling accuracy (Tutar and Hold, 2001 .) In Figure 8.12 and Figure 8.13 the contours of horizontal velocity component, vertical velocity component, pressure and modified turbulent eddy kinematic viscosity obtained from mesh 1 and mesh 2 respectively are shown. Both results are almost identical. As seen, the origin of the vortex street shifts between the areas above and below the central axis. The behavior qualitatively confirms the periodic vortex shedding phenomenon.</p>
