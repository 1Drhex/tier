                <ol> <li>Begin by using the “SYSTEM” menu to establish the units, fluid zones, and pipe specifications for the system.</li> <li>This problem statement indicates that this zone of analysis is a subset of a larger system. In cases like these, it is helpful to utilize another option available within PIPE-FLO® called the “Pressure Boundary.” This option essentially puts a user-entered value for the pressure at a given point in the system. While there is no tank or explicit fluid supply shown in the schematic, the “pressure boundary” assures that fluid is still available and flowing at this start point. A flow demand will also be incorporated into the problem to define the fluid flow rate. For this example, a pressure boundary will be used to represent point A in the system shown above. The amount of pressure at this point is set at 1000 kPa.</li> <li>The main new feature of this example problem is the parallel nature of the piping system. To make a split or convergence of pipes, a “Node” must be used. A node acts as a point in the system where two pipes either split or come together. In this case, the node will represent the tee shown in the problem figure. To create a node at the required point in the problem, draw a pipe from the pressure boundary to an arbitrary point on the FLO-Sheet® and double click until the “dot” appears. Once the dot has appeared, the node has been created. The only input in the properties grid for a node is its elevation. Enter “0” in this case.</li> <li>Ideally, the pressure boundary should be placed on the node so that a pipe isn’t required to connect the pressure boundary to the node. However, PIPE-FLO® won’t allow a pressure boundary to be located at a node. This is an example of the importance of fully understanding the principles before using any engineering software. To make this problem fit the software structure, insert a length of pipe just 1 mm in length. In reality, there will be no such pipe in the system, but it meets the goal of allowing the creation of the model, and keeping any associated loss to be negligible. The figure below represents the pressure boundary connected to the node with the short section of pipe.</li> <li>From this point, the rest of the pipe system can be drawn as done in previous problems. Another node will have to be used where the two pipes converge. To do this, simply double click the mouse after drawing the straight pipe, and connect the lower section of pipe to the same node.</li> <li>As mentioned earlier, a flow demand will be used to represent the flow of the established fluid through the system. The flow demand will represent point B in Fig. 12.4. Enter the 850 L/min value in the properties grid for the flow demand. Although there isn’t a tank to represent the fluid in the system, PIPE-FLO® assumes that the fluid established in the fluid zones menu is actually flowing through the system because of the pressure boundary.</li> <li>Be sure to include the proper number of elbows (3) and the valve as shown in Fig. 12.4. The valve is located under the “Valves” section of the “Valves and Fittings” menu. It is called a “Globe—Angle 90°” valve. Enter that item just like the fittings and valves from previous problems.</li> <li>After the system has been drawn and all components “defined” by entering all the required data, run the calculations as done in previous example problems. The results are shown below.</li> <li>As previously mentioned, the values shown for the short section of pipe between the pressure boundary and the node can be considered negligible because of its short length. Summary of results:</li> </ol> <p class="blog">
<strong>a. </strong>The total pressure drop across each branch is 95 kPa.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong> b. </strong>The pressure at B is 1000 kPa 2 95 kPa = 905 kPa as shown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>c. </strong> The flow rates through the upper and lower sections are 519 and 331 L/min respectively.</p>

Be sure to work Example Problem 12.3 by hand to verify the answers and to demonstrate that the software model duplicates the manual analytical solution.</p>
