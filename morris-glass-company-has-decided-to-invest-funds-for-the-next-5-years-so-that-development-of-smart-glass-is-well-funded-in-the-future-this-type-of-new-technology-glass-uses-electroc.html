This type of new-technology glass uses electrochrome coating to allow rapid adjustment to sun and dark in building glass, as well as assisting with internal heating and cooling cost reduction. The financial plan is to invest first, allow appreciation to occur, and then use the available funds in the future. All cash flow estimates are in $1000 units, and the interest rate expectation is 8% per year.</p> <p class="blog">Years 1 through 5: Invest $7000 in year 1, decreasing by $1000 per year through year 5.<br /> Years 6 through 10: No new investment and no withdrawals.<br /> Years 11 through 15: Withdraw $20,000 in year 11, decreasing 20% per year through year 15</p> <p class="blog">Determine if the anticipated withdrawals will be covered by the investment and appreciation plans.

<strong>Solution by Hand</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 3–16 presents the cash flow diagram and the placement of the equivalent P values used in the solution. Calculate the present worth of both series in actual year 0 and add them to determine if the investment series is adequate to fund the anticipated withdrawals</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Investment series</strong>: Decreasing, conventional arithmetic series starting in year 2 with A = $−7000, G = $−1000, and gradient n = 5 years. The present worth in year 0 is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{G} = −[7000(P∕A,8\%,5) − 1000(P∕G,8\%,5)]= \$−20,577\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Withdrawal series</strong>: Decreasing, shifted geometric series starting in year 12 with <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1}\)</span> = $20,000, <em>g</em> = −0.20, and gradient <em>n</em> = 5 years. If the present worth in year 10 is identified as <span class="tex-text">\(P_{g,0} \)</span> , the present worth in year 0 is <span class="tex-text">\(P_{g,0} \)</span>. Use Equation [2.35] <span class="tex-text">\((P/A,g,i,n)=\begin{cases} \frac{1-\left(\frac{1+g}{1+i}\right)^{n} }{i-g} &amp; g\neq 0 \\ \frac{n}{1+i} &amp; g=0 \end{cases}\)</span> for the (P∕A,−20%,8%,5) factor.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{g,0} = P_{g,10} (P∕F,i,n) = A_{1}(P∕A,g,i,n)(P∕F,i,n)&#8230;&#8230;[3.7] \)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(=20,000\left\{\frac{1-\left[ \frac{-+(-0.20)}{1+0.08} \right]^{5}}{0.08-(-0.20)} \right\} (0.4632)=20,000(2.7750)(0.4632)=\$25,707\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The net total present worth is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{T} = −20,577 + 25,707 = \$+5130\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This means that more is withdrawn than the investment series earns. Either additional funds must be invested or less must be withdrawn to make the series equivalent at 8% per year.<br /> To find the exact amount of the initial withdrawal series to result in <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T} = 0\)</span>, let <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1}\)</span> be an unknown in Equation [3.7] and set <span class="tex-text">\( P_{g,0} = −P_{G} = 20,577.\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(20,577 = A_{1}(2.7750)(0.4632)\)</span><span class="tex-text">\(A_{1} = \$16,009\)</span> in year 11</p>
 <p class="blog">
The geometric series withdrawal would be 20% less each year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Solution by Spreadsheet </strong><br /> See Figure 3–17a. To determine if the investment series will cover the withdrawal series, enter the cash flows (in column B using the functions shown in column C) and apply the NPV function shown in the cell tag to display <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T} = \$+5130\)</span> directly. As above, the + sign indicates that, from a time value of money perspective, there is more withdrawn than invested and earned. The Goal Seek tool is very handy in determining the initial withdrawal amount that results in<span class="tex-text">\( P_{T} = 0\)</span> (cell B19). Figure 3–17b shows the template and result <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1} = \$16,009 \)</span> in year 11. Each succeeding withdrawal is 80% of the previous one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comment</strong><br /> If the withdrawal series is fixed as estimated initially and the investment series base amount A can be increased, the Goal Seek tool can be used to, again, set <span class="tex-text">\(P_{T} = 0\)</span> (cell B19). However, now establish the entry in B4 as the changing cell. The response is <em>A</em> = $−8285, and, as before, succeeding investments are $1000 less.</p>
