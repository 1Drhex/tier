The first step is to determine the power available for pumping. Once this is established, it is possible to determine the pressure and discharge that could be expected from the pump.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assume that the pump operator is a reasonably fit, well-fed male between 20 and 40 years. He could be expected to produce a steady power output of 75 W for long periods. To give you some idea of what this means, it is like walking up and down a flight of stairs in about 20 s. Not so bad for the first few times but think about sustaining this over several hours. In a developing country, where operators may not be so well fed, or operators are women and children, a more reasonable power value might be 30 W.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The pump unit is also not very efficient at converting human power into water power so we need to allow for an efficiency of say 40%.<br /> So taking these figures into account, assume the power input is 30 W (0.03 kW) and the pump efficiency is 40%:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">water power <span class="tex-text">\(\left(kW\right) = \frac{discharge \left({m^{3}}/{s}\right) \times head \left(m\right) }{367}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(0.03 \times 0.4 = \frac{discharge \left({m^{3}}/{s}\right) \times head \left(m\right) }{367}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Power is directly related to both discharge and head, so at the same power input level, if head increases then discharge will decrease and vice versa.</p>
 <p class="blog">
So assume the water lift is 2 m which is typical for many treadle pump applications. Now calculate the discharge using the above power formula:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">discharge <span class="tex-text">\(= \frac{0.03 \times 0.4 \times 367 }{2}= 2.20 m^{3}/{h}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= 0.6 {L}/{s}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
If the water lift is reduced to 1 m, the discharge increases:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">discharge <span class="tex-text">\( =1.2 {L}/{s}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
So when the pumping head is low, the discharge ranges from 0. 6 to 1.2 L/s In some countries, treadle pumps are used to pump water to much higher<br /> heads than this, but there is a limit to this which depends on the operator. The maximum pressure is determined by the weight of the operator who stands on the treadle and applies a downward force on the pistons.</p>
 <p class="blog">
So assume a typical 65 kg operator standing on a treadle immediately above a typical 100-mm diameter piston. Now calculate the pressure using:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Pressure <span class="tex-text">\(\left({N}/{m^{2} }\right) = \frac{force\left(N\right) }{area \left(m^{2}\right)}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Calculate the force and the area:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">max. force from operator (N) = mass of operator (kg) × gravity constant <span class="tex-text">\((m/s^{2})\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= 65 \times 9.81\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= 637 N\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">area of piston <span class="tex-text">\(= \frac{\pi\times d ^{2}}{4} = \frac{\pi\times 0.1^{2}}{4} = 0.007 m^{2} \)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Put values for force and area into the formula to calculate pressure:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Pressure <span class="tex-text">\( = \frac{637 }{0.007 } = 91,000 {N}/{m^{2}} \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Calculate this in terms of head (m) using the pressure head equation:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P = \rho gh\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">head <span class="tex-text">\(\left(m\right) = \frac{P}{\rho g}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(= \frac{91,000}{1,000 \times 9.81} = 9.27 m \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
So the maximum head this operator can achieve pressing his full weight onto the piston is 9 m. In practice, not all operators put their full weight on the treadles and so the actual pressure may be much lower than this, say 5 m. The pressure can be increased by reducing the diameter of the pistons but this will<br /> also reduce the volume of water lifted at each pump stroke. Another way of course would be to get a heavier operator or perhaps use two operators at the same time, which is often done when children are using it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the maximum pressure that can realistically be achieved on this pump is 5 m, then in such circumstances, the water power formula shows that the discharge would be reduced to 0.24 L/s..</p>
 <p class="blog">
Three important points arise from this:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• First, the pumping head is the sum of the suction lift and the delivery lift and so it is the pumping head that is 5 m. Treadle pump suppliers are notorious for quoting delivery and suction lifts separately and this can confuse the buyer who is trying to compare pump performance.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Second, it is clear that you cannot have both high pressure and a large discharge. You can have one or the other and the combination depends on the power available from operator. Basically, there is no ‘free lunch’ – you get out of the pump what you are prepared to put into it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Finally, this is not rocket science. But it does demonstrate how basic hydraulics can be applied usefully to design what is a simple but very effective water lifting device – something that is not always done in practice.</p>
