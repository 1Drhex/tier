            <p class="blog">Marvin (see previous case studies) has been delighted at the growth of his business and<br /> the beginnings of his internationalisation strategy. However, he was rather surprised when<br /> his bank manager, who has provided important new funding for his business, asked him<br /> about his ‘environmental footprint’! The bank manager had told him that being ‘environmentally<br /> friendly’ was important to the future of Marvin’s business and that, in the future,<br /> Marvin may have to include information on his business’s environmental activities, as<br /> ‘environmental accounting’ was something the government had promised to introduce.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Questions</strong><br /> 1 What did the bank manager mean by ‘environmental footprint’?<br /> 2 Why has the bank manager suggested that Marvin should start to think about his<br /> ‘environmental footprint’?<br /> 3 What kind of information would Marvin need in order to assess the ‘environmental<br /> footprint’ of his business?</p>

1 He meant the total impact on the environment of all Marvin’s activities, not only his<br /> own direct environmental impact but also that of the supply chain that provides the<br /> transport, the materials and the props that go into his performances.<br /> 2 The bank manager knows that being ‘environmentally friendly’ is important to the<br /> profile and future success of Marvin’s business. The bank manager is also aware that<br /> the government is moving towards making all businesses provide annual information<br /> on their environmental impact. Even the amount of tax Marvin will have to pay in<br /> the future may depend on this.<br /> 3 Marvin will need to work out details such as the total number of miles travelled<br /> by him and by those providing support and materials for his act, the type of transport<br /> (road, rail, air) the energy used in each performance (electricity, gas, etc.) both<br /> directly and indirectly in his supply chain. There is expected to be a standardised<br /> form which will require specific answers to specific questions, but which will be<br /> attempting to find the impacts of Marvin’s activities on CO2 and other greenhouse<br /> gas emissions, amongst a range of other defined environmental impacts.</p>
