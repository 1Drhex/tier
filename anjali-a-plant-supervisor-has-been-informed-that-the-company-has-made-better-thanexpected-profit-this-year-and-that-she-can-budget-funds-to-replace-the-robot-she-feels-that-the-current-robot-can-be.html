She feels that the current robot can be used for another 5 years. The replacement robot to be bought then will cost $50,000 and last for 5 years. The maintenance costs of the new robot will be $1,200 in the first year, increasing thereafter annually by $200 for the remaining 4 years. Considering the time value of money, she budgets this year for $35,750, which is deposited in a 5-year CD to mature to $50,000.

<span class="fontstyle0">We begin with the comprehension of the problem statement. The time period in this example is year. The current robot is expected to last five more years. The new robot will be purchased at the end of this period (5 years from now).</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Anjali takes out $35,750 from this year’s company profit and deposits this in a 5-year CD. No data is given about the interest rate the CD will earn, but she seems to have worked out that $35,750 will increase to $50,000 at the end of 5 years. This $50,000 sum will be used to buy the new robot that will require maintenance costs during its 5-year life. Thus, this problem involves 10 time periods—5 years of the current robot’s life and 5 years of the new one’s.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">With this comprehension, let us prepare the cashflow table first. The problem seems simple. We can do without an auxiliary table and proceed directly to prepare the twocolumn cashflow table, whose skeleton will look like:</span></p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 648pt" border="0" width="864" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;width: 54pt" align="right" width="72" height="19">10</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">9</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">8</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">7</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">6</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">5</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">4</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">3</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">2</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">1</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">0</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="left" width="72">YEAR</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt" height="19"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR" align="left">AMOUNT</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">We need to gather the relevant data from the problem statement and post them in the table. For row 0, the cashflow is $35,750; the money Anjali sets aside now (this year). Since this is a cost (paid out) to the <span class="tex-text">\(company^{4}\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">, it will have a – sign. For the next 5 years during which the current robot will continue to be used, there are no cashflows. Though the current robot may need maintenance, the associated costs are not given, and hence not a part of the current project. Such costs might have been taken into account while purchasing the current robot. Thus, the cashflows during year 1 through 5 are zero. At the end of the fifth year, $35,750 would have grown to become $50,000. Depending on how this $50,000 is posted, the cashflow table may have two types of entries for year 5, as explained as follows.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">(a) The simplest way to look at the situation is to consider that this $50,000 is paid directly from the CD account to the supplier of the new robot. In that case there is no new cashflow from Anjali’s company to the supplier. Looked this way, there should be no entry for year 5.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">(b) The approach in (a), which looks simpler, will be objected to by professional accountants. What they will insist on is that the accumulated sum $50,000 be shown as an inflow into company books, and a concurrent payment (outflow) of $50,000 be made out to the supplier. Thus, there will be two entries in the cashflow table corresponding to year 5: One as $50,000 and the other as –$50,000. The former is the inflow (+ sign not shown), while the latter the outflow (payment to the robot supplier). The two entries result in a </span><span class="fontstyle2">net </span><span class="fontstyle0">cashflow of zero for year 5, the same as in (a).</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The new robot is acquired at the end of year 5 (same as the beginning of year 6) and its use begun. The maintenance cost during the first year of the new robot’s use is $1,200. This year is the sixth year of the whole project. Thus, for year 6, the maintenance cost of $1,200 is entered with a –ve sign. Since the maintenance costs for subsequent years increase annually by $200, the cashflows for the subsequent years will be 1,400, 1,600, 1,800, and 2,000, all with –ve signs.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0"> Thus, the cashflow table following approach (a) will be:</span></p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 994px;height: 47px" border="0" width="864" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;width: 54pt" align="right" width="72" height="19">10</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">9</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">8</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">7</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">6</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">5</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">4</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">3</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">2</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">1</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="right" width="72">0</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt" align="left" width="72">YEAR</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt"> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt" align="left" height="19">-$2,000</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">-$1,800</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">-$1,600</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">-$1,400</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">-$1,200</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">$0</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">$0</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">$0</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">$0</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">$0</td> <td class="xl65" dir="LTR" align="left">-$33,750</td> <td dir="LTR" align="left">AMOUNT</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">If we follow the strict accounting practice explained in (b) earlier, the cashflow table will be:</span></p>
 <table style="height: 100px" width="992"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="72"> YEAR</td> <td width="72">0</td> <td width="72">1</td> <td width="72">2</td> <td width="72">3</td> <td width="100">4</td> <td width="72">5</td> <td width="72">6</td> <td width="72">7</td> <td width="72">8</td> <td width="72">9</td> <td width="72">10</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <span class="fontstyle0">AMOUNT </span></td> <td>-$33,750</td> <td> <span class="fontstyle0">$0</span></td> <td> <span class="fontstyle0">$0</span></td> <td> <span class="fontstyle0">$0</span></td> <td width="100"> <span class="fontstyle0">$0</span></td> <td>$50,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
($-50,000)</td> <td>-$1,200</td> <td>-$1,400</td> <td>-$1,600</td> <td>-$1,800</td> <td>-$2,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">We can now proceed to draw the cashflow diagram. Since the cashflow table already exists, we do not need to recomprehend the data. Instead we use the cashflow table to develop the diagram. Follow the earlier discussions in Subsection 2.2.1 and the illustrative Example 2.3 on how to develop a diagram.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">For case (a), the cashflow <span class="tex-text">\(diagram^{5}\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0"> </span><span class="fontstyle0">is in Fig. 2.6(a), while for (b) it is in Fig. 2.6(b). Note a few <span class="tex-text">\(“cosmetic” enhancements\)</span> </span><span class="fontstyle0">in these diagrams. For example, the time periods have been labeled above the timeline to add clarity. Their usual labeling—below the timeline </span><span class="fontstyle0">and slightly off to the right of the time markers—would have been congested. Note also that we did not label each time period, skipping the odd ones 1, 3, &#8230;; when space is limited, this is acceptable. In fact, some analysts do not label the time periods at all, especially if there are fewer periods that can easily be comprehended. Further, the cashflow amounts have been normalized to thousands, reducing the number of digits required to label them. However, a qualifying note to this effect must be made at a prime location in the diagram, as in Fig. 2.6 at the top (Amount in Thousands of Dollars). Some people use the notation k (always lower case), which stands for a thousand. In that case, the cashflow data in Fig. 2.6 might have been labeled as 35.75k, 1.2k, 1.4k, &#8230;, without the qualifying note <span class="tex-text">\(Amount in Thousands of Dollars\)</span>.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Cosmetic enhancements are meant to add clarity to cashflow diagrams. A clear and unambiguous diagram is likely to lead to an error-free solution. Use your imagination to achieve clarity</span></p>
