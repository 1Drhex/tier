            <p class="blog">Cutting Paper Rolls at Rheem Paper</p> <p class="blog">The Rheem Paper Company produces rolls of paper of various types for its customers. One type is produced in standard rolls that are 60 inches wide and (when unwound) 200 yards long. Customers for this type of paper order rolls that are all 200 yards long, but can have any of the widths 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, or 40 inches. In a given week, Rheem waits for all orders and then decides how to cut its 60-inch rolls to satisfy the orders. For example, if there are five orders for 15-inch widths and two orders for 40-inch widths, Rheem could satisfy the order by producing three rolls, cutting each of the first two into a 40-inch and a 15-inch cut (with 5 inches left over) and cutting the third into four 15-inch cuts (with one of these left over). Each week, Rheem must decide how to cut its rolls in the most economical way to meet its orders. Specifically, it wants to cut as few rolls as possible.<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To find a way of cutting paper rolls in various widths so as to satisfy all customer orders and minimize the total number of rolls cut.<br /> Where Do the Numbers Come From?<br /> The company knows the various widths its customers need, and it knows the orders for the various widths in the current week.</p>

Given the width of the rolls (60 inches) and the available widths (12, 15, 20, 24, 30, and 40), the first thing to do in this model is to “preprocess” the patterns that might be used. For example, one reasonable pattern is to cut a roll into four 15-inch cuts. In fact, this is perfect—there is no waste. Another pattern is to cut a roll into a 12-inch, a 15-inch, and a 24-inch cut, with 9 inches left over and unusable. The only patterns we consider (the feasible patterns) are the ones with no leftover paper that could be used for customer orders. For example, the pattern of a 12-inch cut and a 30-inch cut is not worth considering because another 12-inch (or 15-inch) cut could be obtained from the remainder. There is no model for determining all feasible patterns. You simply need to go through all the possibilities in a systematic way. After all possible patterns have been listed, the problem is then to decide how many rolls to cut into each pattern.<br /> With this in mind, Figure 6.35 shows the variables and constraints required for this model. (See the file Cutting Stock Big Picture.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model appears in Figure 6.36. (See the file Cutting Stock Finished.xlsx.) To develop<br /> it, follow these steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the roll width, the available widths, and the number of orders for each width in the blue ranges. The orders in the Required range (row 42) will change from week to week, but the same model can handle any values in this range.<br /> 2) Patterns. Enter the feasible patterns in columns B through G, starting in row 10. The numbers in each row indicate how many of each width is in the pattern. For example, the first pattern has five 12-inch cuts with no waste. You can calculate the waste in column H by entering the formula<br /> =$B$3-SUMPRODUCT(B$9:G$9,B10:G10)<br /> and copying down. This waste column is useful as you try to list all feasible patterns. Specifically, the waste must be nonnegative, and it must be no greater than 12, the smallest available width. (If the waste were 12 or greater, it would be possible to get another usable cut from the pattern.) For this particular roll width and this particular set of available widths, there are 26 feasible patterns. (You have to be careful when listing them. It is easy to miss some.)<br /> 3) Decision variables. Enter any values into the Rolls_cut range. These are the decision variable cells in this model. They indicate how many rolls to cut into the various patterns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Widths obtained. Calculate the number of each width obtained by entering the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Rolls_cut,B10:B35)<br /> in cell B40 and copying it to the rest of the Obtained range. For example, the value in cell B40 is the number of rolls of width 12 inches obtained from all possible patterns.<br /> 5) Rolls cut. Calculate the number of rolls cut in cell B46 with the formula<br /> =SUM(Rolls_cut)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> Fill out the Solver dialog box as indicated in Figure 6.37. The objective is to minimize the number of rolls produced, subject to meeting customer orders. Also, the number cut according to each pattern must be an integer (but not binary). As usual, you should check the Non-Negative option and choose the Simplex LP method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution indicates that Rheem can meet its customer orders this week with 47 rolls, cut as specified in rows 10 through 35. For example, 12 of the 47 rolls should be cut according to pattern 4, each with three 12-inch rolls and one 24-inch roll. (There is at least one other optimal solution with objective value 47 that you might find.) Note that there are two sources of waste in this solution. First, there is the unusable waste from all leftover rolls with width less than 12 inches. For example, there are two 1-inch rolls left over from the two rolls cut into pattern 20. Second, there is some waste from the usable rolls that are not needed in this week’s orders. Fortunately, it is minimal—only one 15-inch roll is left over. Actually, if Rheem solves this model on a weekly basis, the model could easily incorporate the inventory of usable leftover rolls from previous weeks. As the finished version of the file indicates, minimizing the number of rolls cut is equivalent to minimizing the total waste. (This total waste is calculated in cell E46, using the differences in row 43.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Solver Integer Optimality Setting</strong><br /> Until now, we have suggested changing the Solver Integer Optimality setting to 0%. This guarantees the optimal solution. However, this example illustrates why the default setting is not 0%. If you change the setting to 0% and then run Solver, you will see that Solver quickly gets to a solution that requires 47 rolls, but then it runs and runs and runs. (We got tired of waiting, so we pressed the Ctrl+Break key combination to stop it prematurely.) After some experimenting, we found that with the setting at 2% or above, the solution is obtained almost instantaneously, but with the setting at 1% or 0%, it runs seemingly forever. This behavior is not at all uncommon in IP models. Solver often finds a very good or even optimal solution very quickly, but then it takes a long time to verify that it is optimal (or to find something slightly better). The moral is clear. If you change the setting to a low value and find that the Solver is taking forever without getting anywhere, press Ctrl+Break to get out. By that time, you probably already have a very good or even optimal solution. (If you run the free OpenSolver add-in mentioned in the Chapter 3 Appendix on this model, you will see that it finds the optimal solution almost instantaneously. This proves that Excel’s Solver does not have the fastest available algorithm for integer-constrained models. Researchers are continuing to improve optimization algorithms, and OpenSolver evidently contains very good ones.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> We did not perform any sensitivity analysis on this model because there is no obvious sensitivity analysis to perform. The only inputs are the roll width, the set of available widths, and the order amounts. Although it would make sense to perform sensitivity analysis on the order amounts, it would make more sense (in a realistic setting) to wait for next week’s orders and simply solve the problem again. Note that the model is not set up to perform sensitivity analysis (with SolverTable) on the roll width or the set of available widths. If these change, the entire table of patterns must be recreated manually. For example, if the roll width changes to 64 inches, patterns 2, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 23 are no longer in the list (why not?), and several new patterns enter the list (what are they?).</p>
