The current price of suits to customers is $350, which leads to annual sales of 300 suits. The elasticity of the demand for men’s suits is estimated to be 22.5 and assumed to be constant over the relevant price range.

The variables and constraints for this pricing model appear in Figure 7.18. (See the file Pricing with Complementary Products Big Picture.xlsx.) As in the previous two examples, you must first determine the demand function for suits. Although this could be a linear function or some other form, we again assume a constant elasticity function of the form D = a<span class="tex-text">\(P^{b}\)</span>, where the exponent b is the elasticity. The solution from this point is practically the same as the solution to  except for the profit function. Each suit sold also generates demand for 2.0 shirts and 1.5 ties (on average), which contributes 2.0(25) + 1.5(15) extra dollars in profit. Therefore, it makes sense that the profit- maximizing price for suits is lower than in the absence of shirts and ties. The company wants to generate more demand for suits so that it can reap the benefits from shirts and ties. The only constraint is that the price of suits should be at least as large as the unit cost of suits. (Or, as suggested in the big picture, is this constraint really necessary? We discuss this question shortly.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet solution appears in Figure 7.19. (See the file Pricing with Complementary Products Finished.xlsx.) Instead of solving a single model, you will actually solve two: the one stated previously and one where shirts and ties are ignored. This way you can see the effect that shirts and ties have on the optimal price of suits. You could set this up as two distinct models, but a clever use of SolverTable allows you to treat both cases in a single model. The following steps are required.<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter all inputs in the light blue regions.<br /> 2) Constant for demand function. The demand function is of the form D = a<span class="tex-text">\(P^{b}\)</span>. You can find the constant a from the current demand and price for suits: 300 =a(<span class="tex-text">\(350^{-2.5}\)</span>), so that a = 300/<span class="tex-text">\(350^{-2.5}\)</span>. Therefore, calculate this constant a in cell B9 with the formula<br /> =B5/B4^B10</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Sensitivity factor. The model treats both cases, when shirts and ties are ignored and when they are not, by using SolverTable with a “sensitivity factor” as the input cell. When this factor is 0, the complementary products are ignored; when it is positive, they are taken into consideration. Enter 1 in the sensitivity factor cell E9 for now. In general, this factor determines the average number of shirts and ties purchased with the purchase of a suit—this factor is multiplied by the values in the E5:F5 range. When this factor is 1, you get the values in the statement of the problem. When it is 0, no shirts and ties are purchased with a suit.<br /> 4) Price, demand. Enter any price in cell B13, and calculate the corresponding demand for suits in cell B14 with the formula<br /> =B9*B13^B10<br /> 5) Profits. The total profit is the profit from suits alone, plus the extra profit from shirts and ties that are purchased along with suits. Calculate the first of these in cell B15 with the formula<br /> =(Price-Unit cost)*B14<br /> and calculate the second in cell B16 with the formula<br /> =E9*SUMPRODUCT(E5:F5,E6:F6)*B14<br /> Then sum them to get the total profit in cell B17. Note that the sensitivity factor in cell E9 scales the extra profit, depending on how many ties and shirts per suit are sold. If the value in cell E9 is 0, no shirts and ties are sold; if this value is 1, the numbers of shirts and ties stated in the problem are sold.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup, not shown here, is the same as in. The objective is to maximize profit, with the price of suits as the only decision variable. The only constraint is that this price must be at least as large as the unit cost of suits.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 7.19 uses a sensitivity factor of 1 in cell E9, which means that every suit sale is accompanied (on average) by the sale of 2.0 shirts and 1.5 ties. This induces the company to keep the suit price relatively low, at $412.50, so that it can sell a lot of suits and therefore a lot of shirts and ties. In fact, you can see that the total profit is nearly evenly divided between the profit from suits and the profit from shirts and ties.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To see the effect of complementary products, run SolverTable with cell E9 as the single input cell, varied, say, from 0 to 2 (or any other upper limit you like) in increments of 0.5, and keep track of price, demand, and profit. (See Figure 7.20). The SolverTable results show that when the company ignores shirts and ties (or, equivalently, suits do not generate any demand for shirts and ties), the optimal price is set high, at $533.33. However, as more ties and shirts are purchased by purchasers of suits, the optimal price of suits decreases fairly dramatically. As you would expect, as more shirts and ties are purchased with suits, the company makes more profit—if it takes shirts and ties into account and prices suits properly. Interestingly, if the sensitivity factor increases to 2, so that customers on average buy 3 ties and 4 shirts with every suit, the company sets its price so that it just breaks even on suits and makes all of its profit on ties and shirts. (If you are skeptical of this result, read the “Is the Constraint Needed?” section that follows.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the situation in the problem statement, how much profit does the company lose if it ignores shirts and ties? You can answer this by entering $533.33 in the Price cell, keeping the sensitivity factor equal to 1. You will find that profit decreases from $32,826 to $29,916, which is a drop of about 9%. This is the penalty for pricing in a way that ignores shirts and ties.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> As in the preceding two examples, the graph in Figure 7.19, formed from a data table of profit versus price, indicates that the Solver solution is optimal—there are no local maxima. Therefore, the Multistart option is not necessary.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Constraint Needed?</strong><br /> In pricing models, you hardly think twice before constraining the price to be at least as large as the unit cost. However, it might make sense to price a product below cost if sales of this product lead to sales—and profits—from other products. Therefore, we deleted the constraint on price in the example and reran SolverTable. The results appear in Figure 7.21. The only change is in the last row, where the sensitivity factor is 2. The company should now price the suits below cost, just to sell more shirts and ties. In fact, the only reason the company priced to break even in this row before was the constraint—a price below the unit cost wasn&#8217;t allowed. When this behavior is allowed, the profit increases from its earlier value of $54,423 to $55,210.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Automobile and appliance dealers who profit from maintenance contracts could probably increase their profits significantly if they factored the profits from the maintenance agreements into the determination of prices of their major products. That is, we suspect that the prices of their major products are set too high—not from the customers’ standpoint but from the dealers’. Probably the ultimate tie-in reduction in price is the fact that many companies now provide free software. They are hoping, of course, that the receiver of free software will later buy the complementary product, which is the upgrade.</p>
