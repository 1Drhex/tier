            <p class="blog">The following two statements were posted on a web site (www.interfluidity.com) in a discussion of agency costs and leveraged investment funds. Leveraged investment funds are funds such as a hedge funds that borrow a considerable amount of money to investment in securities.</p> <p class="blog">Limited liability creates a potential conflict of interest between investment funds and their creditors. If a fund is heavily leveraged, fund investors can reap large rewards by assuming risky positions with the understanding that if those positions go sour, a large fraction of the cost can be shifted (via actual or threatened bankruptcy) to the fund’s creditors.</p> <p class="blog">a. What is meant by “limited liability”?</p> <p class="blog">b. Explain whether you agree or disagree with the excerpt.</p> <p class="blog">Like any other sort of investment manager, the interests of those who manage funds for pensions, university endowments, and charitable foundations may diverge from the interests of their diverse clientele. In particular, rational, self-interested managers may determine that pursuing peer-competitive short-term gains is wiser than carefully managing the long-term risks of<br /> fund stakeholders.</p> <p class="blog">c. What do economists call the types of costs associated with the actions described in this excerpt?</p> <p class="blog">d. What is meant by “stakeholders”?</p>

a. Limited liability is the limit on the financial responsibility of a party to the obligations of an entity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
b. Agree: The limited liability imposes a burden on the creditors because they may not receive the full amount that they are due if the fund is bankrupt. Disagree: Though the limited liability imposes a burden, the additional risk provides a potential for additional rewards, which would in that case offer more protection of the interests of the creditors.</p>
 <p class="blog">
c. The seeking of short-term gains at the expense of long-term value and risks would be a form of agency costs. The motives of a fund manager to be “competitive” and perhaps even affect short-term compensation are self-serving motives.</p>
 <p class="blog">
d. Stakeholders are any party affected by the actions of another. In the case of the management of funds, the stakeholders include not only the fund beneficiaries, but any party that becomes obligated to make up short-falls, anyone employed by the charity that may lose their job, anyone whose services are curtailed because of a lack of funds.</p>
