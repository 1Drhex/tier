            <p class="blog">On 3 July 2016, Marvin, the founder of Machiq Limited (see previous case studies), was<br /> sorting through the morning’s correspondence. After reading one particular letter, he<br /> immediately summoned his fellow directors, Chiquita and Trixie, to an emergency meeting.<br /> He passed the letter round and awaited their comments. The letter read as follows:<br /> Dear Marvin<br /> I have not written to you since 30 June 2014, when I demanded compensation for the<br /> cruel way you sacked me and my family back in 2012. However, I realised that you<br /> would not pay me the £10m I demanded, so I devoted my energies to building a rival<br /> business. I rejoined my old employer, Kaboosh Limited, and worked so hard that I was<br /> appointed managing director. When my close friend and company chairman, Cardew<br /> Kaboosh, died two months ago, he left all his shares to me, so I now own 95% of the company.<br /> My company’s performance has been so impressive that I now want to take over<br /> your company. I am enclosing a copy of the most recent income statement and statement<br /> of financial position of Kaboosh Limited for information.<br /> Yours sincerely,<br /> Esmeralda<br /> After reading the letter, it was agreed that Trixie would analyse the financial summaries<br /> of Kaboosh Limited and compare them with those of Machiq Limited. She compiled the<br /> following summary:</p> <p style="text-align: center;">Income statements for the year ended 30 June 2016</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 541px;" width="733"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="212"></td> <td width="64">Machiq<br /> £</td> <td width="64">Kaboosh<br /> £</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Revenue</td> <td>705,600</td> <td>1,102,500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Cost of sales</td> <td>(529,200)</td> <td>(661,500)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gross profit</td> <td>176,400</td> <td>441,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Expenses</td> <td>(58,600)</td> <td>(175,000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Operating profit for the year</td> <td>117,800</td> <td>266,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Finance costs</td> <td>(1,800)</td> <td>(12,000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Profit for the year, before tax</td> <td>116,000</td> <td>254,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Tax</td> <td>(26,950)</td> <td>(47,000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Profit for the year, after tax</td> <td>89,050</td> <td>207,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Dividends</td> <td>(32,000)</td> <td>(55,000)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retained profit for the year</td> <td>57,050</td> <td>152,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retained profit brought forward</td> <td>42,100</td> <td>645,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retained profit carried forward</td> <td>99,150</td> <td>797,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Comments:<br /> (i) Profitability: We are comparing just one year’s results for each company, so we<br /> must be cautious in drawing conclusions, as trends may show an improvement or<br /> decline when compared with previous years. With this proviso, Machiq Limited’s<br /> ROCE is impressively high compared with Kaboosh’s, indicating that Machiq<br /> is operating profitably from a relatively low capital base. It could also mean that<br /> Kaboosh has been investing in new non-current assets, and expects profitability to<br /> increase significantly as a result.<br /> Kaboosh’s margins are higher than Machiq’s. If we assume that the companies are<br /> selling the same type of goods, then Machiq could seemingly raise its prices without<br /> affecting sales. Another interpretation is that Kaboosh is controlling its buying<br /> prices and costs much more efficiently than Machiq.<br /> (ii) Efficiency: In terms of efficiency, in all respects Machiq is performing better than<br /> Kaboosh. Non-current assets are producing over three times as much sales, inventory<br /> is sold every 22.5 days (compared with a lengthy 138.7 days) and debts are<br /> being collected three times as quickly. The only surprise is that creditors are<br /> paid so fast – it would be more efficient to take advantage of interest-free credit<br /> and pay creditors after approximately 30 days. Kaboosh’s inventory turn is very<br /> worrying – why has it let inventory build up to such an extent? Is part of the inventory<br /> unsaleable and perhaps overvalued?<br /> (iii) Short-term solvency and liquidity: Kaboosh has a good current ratio, though the<br /> acid test could be slightly stronger. Machiq’s ratios are very low, and the acid<br /> test shows only 41p of quickly realisable assets for every £1 of current liabilities.<br /> Machiq’s management should reassess the dividend levels to improve the current<br /> and acid test ratios. Kaboosh has a worryingly high negative cash conversion cycle.<br /> (iv) Long-term solvency and liquidity: Machiq has no long-term borrowings, so the<br /> gearing is zero. Kaboosh is low-geared at 17.1%. Neither company has any problems<br /> over safety of interest payments, with cover of 65 and 22 times respectively.<br /> (v) Investment ratios: Neither company would have a stock market price (not being<br /> listed plcs), so the p/e ratio may not be a realistic comparison. However, the dividend<br /> yield has been calculated on the basis of a share price 15 times the eps. Both<br /> companies have reasonable safety of dividend, though Machiq’s generous dividend<br /> policy results in a higher yield than that of Kaboosh.<br /> (b) Purely on the basis of the ratio comparison with Machiq Limited, the key concerns<br /> within Kaboosh Limited’s financial statements are:<br /> • Low return on capital employed<br /> • Poor working capital control, especially inventory<br /> Within Machiq Limited’s statements, the key concerns are:<br /> • Lower profit margins<br /> • Poor liquidity.<br /> The poor liquidity, if uncorrected, could prove fatal to Machiq Limited, so the<br /> directors need to address this problem urgently. Once they can overcome this, they<br /> may feel that they do not need to sell out to Kaboosh Limited, especially in view of<br /> Machiq’s massively higher return on capital employed. Before a decision can be<br /> taken, the following further information is needed:<br /> • How much is Kaboosh Limited offering for the shares in Machiq Limited?<br /> • What steps is Kaboosh Limited taking to overcome its poor working capital<br /> control?</p>
 <p class="blog">
• What plans does Kaboosh Limited have for improving its return on capital<br /> employed?<br /> • What roles will the three directors of Machiq Limited have in the new company, and<br /> are they acceptable? What salaries would they be paid?</p>
