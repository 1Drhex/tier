Discussion with a consultant indicated that data from stores that met and that did not meet anticipated sales could be used to develop a multiple regression model. The consultant suggested that the second year’s sales should be used as the dependent variable, Y. A regression model would be used to predict second-year sales as a function of several independent variables that define the area surrounding the store. Stores would be located only where the predicted sales exceeded a minimum level. The model would also indicate the effect of various independent variables on sales.</p>
 <p class="blog">
After considerable discussion with people in the company, the consultant recommended the following independent variables:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{1}\)</span> = size of store</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{2}\)</span> = traffic volume on highway in front of store</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{3}\)</span> = stand-alone store versus shopping mall location</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{4}\)</span> = location of competing store within 1&gt;4 mile</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{5}\)</span> = per capita income of population within 5 miles</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{6}\)</span> = total number of people within 5 miles</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{7}\)</span> = per capita income of population within 10 miles</p>
 <p class="blog">
8. <span class="tex-text">\(X_{8}\)</span> = total number of people within 10 miles</p>
 <p class="blog">
Multiple regression was used to obtain estimates of the coefficients of the sales prediction model from data collected for all stores opened during the past 8 years. The data set included both those stores that were still operating and those that were closed. A model was developed that could be used to predict second-year sales. This estimated equation included coefficient estimators, <span class="tex-text">\(b_{j}\)</span>, for the model parameters, <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{j}\)</span>. To apply the estimated equation</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\hat{y} _{i} = b_{0} + \sum\limits_{j=1}^{8}{b_{j}x_{ji} }\)</span> <p class="blog">
measurements of the independent variables were collected for each proposed new store location and the predicted sales were computed for that location. A predicted sales level was used, along with the judgment of marketing analysts and a committee of successful store managers, as input to the store location decision process.</p>
