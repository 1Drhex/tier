            <p class="blog">Two years ago, Toshiba Electronics made a $15 million investment in new assembly line machinery. It purchased approximately 200 units at $70,000 each and placed them in plants in 10 different countries. The equipment sorts, tests, and performs insertion-order kitting of components in preparation for the assembly of special-purpose circuit boards. This year, new international industry standards will require a $16,000 retrofit on each unit, in addition to the expected operating cost. Due to the new standards, coupled with rapidly changing technology, a new system is challenging the retention of these 2-year-old machines. Since the chief engineer at Toshiba USA realizes that the economics must be considered, he has asked that a replacement study be performed this year and each year in the future, if need be. The <em>i</em> is 10% and the estimates are below.</p> <p class="blog">Challenger: First cost: $50,000<br /> Future market values: decreasing by 20% per year<br /> Estimated retention period: no more than 10 years<br /> AOC estimates: $5000 in year 1 with increases of $2000 per year<br /> thereafter<br /> Defender: Current international market value: $15,000<br /> Future market values: decreasing by 20% per year<br /> Estimated retention period: no more than 3 more years<br /> AOC estimates: $4000 next year, increasing by $4000 per year<br /> thereafter, plus the $16,000 retrofit next year</p> <p class="blog">(a) Determine the AW values and economic service lives necessary to perform the replacement study.<br /> (b) Perform the replacement study now.<br /> (c) After 1 year, it is time to perform the follow-up analysis. The challenger is making large inroads to the market for electronic components assembly equipment, especially with the new international standards features built in. The expected market value for the defender is still $12,000 this year, but it is expected to drop to virtually nothing in the future—$2000 next year on the worldwide market and zero after that. Also, this prematurely outdated equipment is more costly to keep serviced, so the estimated AOC next year has been increased from $8000 to $12,000 and to $16,000 two years out. Perform the follow-up replacement study analysis</p>

(a) The results of the ESL analysis, shown in Figure 11–5, include all the MV and AOC estimates in columns B and C. For the challenger, note that P = $50,000 is also the MV in year 0. The total AW of costs is for each year, should the challenger be placed into service for that number of years. As an example, the year k = 4 amount of $−19,123 is determined using Equation [11.3]<span class="tex-text">\( AW_{K}=-P(A/P,i,k)+S_{k}(A/F,i,k)-\left[\sum\limits_{j=1}^{j=k}{AOC_{j}(P/F,i,j)} \right](A/P,i,k) \)</span>, where the A∕G factor accommodates the arithmetic gradient series in the AOC.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Total<span class="tex-text">\( AW_{4} = −50,000(A∕P,10\%,4) + 20,480(A∕F,10\%,4) − [5000 + 2000(A∕G,10\%,4)] = \$−19,123\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
For spreadsheet-based ESL analysis, this same result is achieved in cell F8 using Equation [11.4] Capital recovery for the challenger: PMT(i%,years,P,−MV_in_year_k)<br /> Capital recovery for the defender: PMT(i%,years,current_MV,−MV_in_year_k)<br /> AW of AOC: −PMT(i%,years,NPV(i%,year_1_AOC:<br /> year_k_AOC)+0)<br /> . The functions are</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Total<span class="tex-text">\( AW_{4} = PMT(10\%,4,50000,−20480) − PMT(10\%,4,NPV(10\%,C5:C8)+0)= −11,361 − 7,762=\$ −19,123\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The defender costs are analyzed in the same way up to the maximum retention period of 3 years.<br /> The lowest AW cost (numerically largest) values for the replacement study are as follows:</p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px">Challenger: <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{C} = \)</span>$−19,123 for <span class="tex-text">\(n_{C} = 4\)</span> years<br /> Defender: <span class="tex-text">\(AW_{D} = \)</span>$−17,307 for <span class="tex-text">\(n_{D} = 3\)</span> years</p>
 <p class="blog">
The challenger total AW of cost curve (Figure 11–5) is classically shaped and relatively flat between years 3 and 6; there is virtually no difference in the total AW for years 4 and 5. For the defender, note that the estimated AOC values change substantially over 3 years, and they do not constantly increase or decrease.<br /> (b) To perform the replacement study now, apply only the first step of the procedure. Select the defender because it has the better AW of costs ($−17,307), and expect to retain it for 3 more years. Prepare to perform the one-year-later analysis 1 year from now.<br /> (c) One year later, the situation has changed significantly for the equipment Toshiba retained last year. Apply the steps for the one-year-later analysis:<br /> 2. After 1 year of defender retention, the challenger estimates are still reasonable, but the defender market value and AOC estimates are substantially different. Go to step 3 to perform a new ESL analysis for the defender.<br /> 3. The defender estimates in Figure 11–5 are updated below for the ESL analysis. New AW values are calculated using Equation [11.3]. There is now a maximum of 2 more years of retention, 1 year less than the 3 years determined last year.</p>

The AW and n values for the new replacement study are as follows:</p>

Now select the challenger based on its favorable AW value. Therefore, replace the defender now, not 2 years from now. Expect to keep the challenger for 4 years, or until a better challenger appears on the scene</p>
