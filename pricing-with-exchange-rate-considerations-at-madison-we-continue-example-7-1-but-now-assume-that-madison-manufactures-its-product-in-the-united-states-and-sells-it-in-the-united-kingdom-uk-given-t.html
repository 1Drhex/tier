The big picture for this model is shown in Figure 7.15, and the spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 7.16. (See the files Pricing Globally Big Picture.xlsx and Pricing Globally Finished.xlsx.) It is very similar to the previous model, so we highlight only the new features. The exchange rate in cell B4 indicates the number of dollars required to purchase one pound. For example, with an exchange rate of 1.22, it takes $1.22 to purchase one pound. Alternatively, 1y1.22 = £0.82 is required to purchase one dollar. As this exchange rate decreases, we say that the dollar gets stronger; as it increases, the dollar gets weaker. Note that you divide by the exchange rate to convert dollars to pounds,and you multiply by the exchange rate to convert pounds to dollars. With this in mind,the model development is straightforward.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The following steps are required:<br /> 1) Inputs. The inputs are the unit cost (in dollars), the exchange rate, and the parameters of the company’s demand function for the UK market. These latter values would need to be estimated exactly as discussed in the previous example. This examples uses “reasonable” values for these parameters, as shown in row 10.<br /> 2) Unit cost in pounds. Although Madison’s unit cost occurs in the United States and is expressed in dollars, it is convenient to express it in pounds. Do this in cell B6 with the formula<br /> =B3/B4<br /> This value is used to form a constraint on the price: the unit price in pounds must be no less than the unit cost, measured in the same currency.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Price, demand. As in the previous example, enter any price in cell B13 (which is now in pounds), and calculate the demand in cell B14 from the demand function with the formula<br /> =B10*Price_Pounds^C10<br /> 4) Profit. The profit should be in dollars, so enter the formula<br /> =(Price_Pounds*B4-B3)*B14<br /> in cell B15. Note that the unit cost is already in dollars, but the UK price must be converted to dollars.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box (not shown here) is set up exactly as in Figure 7.13, except that the constraint on price is now Price_Pounds ≥ UnitCost_Pounds, so that pounds are compared to pounds. In fact, the specification of this constraint is the only place where the value in cell B6 enters the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution, with an exchange rate of 1.22, says that Madison should charge £70.26 per unit in the UK. This creates demand for about 1019 units. Each of these costs $50 to produce, and the dollar revenue from each of them is 70.26(1.22), or $85.71. (See cell E13.) The resulting profit in dollars is approximately $36,392. The graph in Figure 7.16, created from a data table of profit versus price, shows how profit declines on either side of the optimal price. (If you compare this to the solution in the fifth edition of the book, when the exchange rate was 1.66, you will see quite a change.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> As in the previous example, the objective is not necessarily a concave function of price for all possible values of the input parameters. However, the graph in Figure 7.16 indicates that it is concave for our particular input parameters and that the Solver solution is indeed optimal. Therefore, the Multistart option is not necessary.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> What happens when the dollar gets stronger or weaker? You can use SolverTable with the exchange rate as the single input, allowing it to vary from 1.15 to 1.35 in increments of 0.02, and keeping track of price, demand, and profit. The results in Figure 7.17 indicate that as the exchange rate increases (the dollar weakens), Madison charges less in pounds for the product but obtains a higher profit. The opposite is true when the dollar strengthens. Are these results in line with your economic intuition? Note that when the dollar strengthens, pounds are not worth as much to a U.S. company. Therefore, when the pound revenue is converted to dollars in the profit cell, the profit tends to decrease. But in this case, why does the optimal price in pounds increase? We will say no more here—except that this should be a good question for class discussion.</p>
