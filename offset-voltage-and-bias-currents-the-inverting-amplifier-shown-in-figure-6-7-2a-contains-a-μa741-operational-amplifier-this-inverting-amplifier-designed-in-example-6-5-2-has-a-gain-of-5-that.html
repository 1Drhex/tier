In Figure 6.7-2b, the operational amplifier has been replaced by the offsets model of an operational amplifier. Notice that the operational amplifier in Figure 6.7-2b is the ideal operational amplifier that is part of the model of the operational amplifier used to account for the offsets. The circuit in Figure 6.7-2b contains four inputs that correspond to the four independent sources <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}, i_{b1}, i_{b2}, and v_{os}\)</span>. (The input <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}\)</span> is obtained by connecting a voltage source to the circuit. In contrast, the “inputs” <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}, i_{b2}, and v_{os}\)</span> are the results of imperfections of the operational amplifier. These inputs are part of the operational amplifier model and do not need to be added to the circuit.) Superposition can be used to good advantage in analyzing this circuit. Figures 6.7-2c–6.7-2f illustrate this process. In each of these figures, all but one input has been set to zero, and the output due to that one input has been calculated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 6.7-2c shows the circuit used to calculate the response to <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}\)</span> alone. The other inputs <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}, i_{b2}, and v_{os}\)</span> have all been set to zero. Recall that zero current sources act like open circuits and zero voltage sources act like short circuits. Figure 6.7-2c is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current sources <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}, i_{b2}\)</span> by open circuits and by replacing the voltage source <span class="tex-text">\(v_{os}\)</span> by a short circuit. The operational amplifier in Figure 6.7-2c is the ideal operational amplifier that is part of the offsets model. Analysis of the inverting amplifier in Figure 6.7-2c gives<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = -5 \cdot v_{in}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, consider Figure 6.7-2d. This circuit is used to calculate the response to <span class="tex-text">\(v_{os}\)</span> alone. The other inputs <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}, i_{b1}, and i_{b2}\)</span> have all been set to zero. Figure 6.7-2d is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current sources <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1} and i_{b2}\)</span> by open circuits and by replacing the voltage source <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}\)</span> by a short circuit. Again, the operational amplifier is the ideal operational amplifier from the offsets model. The circuit in Figure 6.7-2d is one we have seen before; it is the noninverting amplifier (Figure 6.5-1b). Analysis of this noninverting amplifier gives</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_o=\left(1+\frac{50,000}{10,000} \right)\cdot v_{os}=6 v_{os}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Next, consider Figure 6.7-2e. This circuit is used to calculate the response to <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}\)</span> alone. The other inputs <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}, v_{os}, and i_{b2}\)</span> have all been set to zero. Figure 6.7-2e is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current source <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b2}\)</span> by an open circuit and by replacing the voltage sources <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{os}\)</span> by short circuits. Notice that the voltage across the 10-kΩ resistor is zero because this resistor is connected between the input nodes of the ideal operational amplifier. Ohm’s law says that the current in the 10-kΩ resistor must be zero. The current in the 50-kΩ resistor is <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}\)</span>. Finally, paying attention to the reference directions,<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = 50,000 \cdot i_{b1}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 6.7-2f is used to calculate the response to <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b2}\)</span> alone. The other inputs <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}, v_{os}, and i_{b1}\)</span> have all been set to zero. Figure 6.7-2f is obtained from Figure 6.7-2b by replacing the current source <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b1}\)</span> by an open circuit and by replacing the voltage sources <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in} and v_{os}\)</span> by short circuits. Replacing <span class="tex-text">\(v_{os}\)</span> by a short circuit inserts a short circuit across the current source <span class="tex-text">\(i_{b2}\)</span>. Again, the voltage across the 10-kΩ resistor is zero, so the current in the 10-kΩ resistor must be zero. Kirchhoff’s current law shows that the current in the 50-kΩ resistor is also zero. Finally,<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = 0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The output caused by all four inputs working together is the sum of the outputs caused by each input working alone. Therefore,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = -5 \cdot v_{in} + 6 \cdot v_{os} + (50,000)i_{b1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
When the input of the inverting amplifier <span class="tex-text">\(v_{in}\)</span> is zero, the output <span class="tex-text">\(v_o\)</span> also should be zero. However, <span class="tex-text">\(v_o\)</span> is nonzero when we have a finite <span class="tex-text">\(v_{os} or i_{b1}\)</span>. Let</p>
 <p class="blog">
output offset voltage <span class="tex-text">\(= 6 \cdot v_{os} + (50,000)i_{b1}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Then <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = -5 \cdot v_{in} +\)</span> output offset voltage</p>
 <p class="blog">
Recall that when the operational amplifier is modeled as an ideal operational amplifier, analysis of this inverting amplifier gives<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(v_o = -5 \cdot v_{in}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Comparing these last two equations shows that bias currents and input offset voltage cause the output offset voltage. Modeling the operational amplifier as an ideal operational amplifier amounts to assuming that the output offset voltage is not important and thus ignoring it. Using the operational amplifier model that accounts for offsets is more accurate but also more complicated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
How large is the output offset voltage of this inverting amplifier? The input offset voltage of a μA741 operational amplifier will be at most 5 mV, and the bias current will be at most 500 nA, so</p>
 <p class="blog">
output offset voltage <span class="tex-text">\(\leq 6(0.005) + (50 \times 10^3) (500 \times 10^{-9}) = 55 mV\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
We note that we can ignore the effect of the offset voltage only when <span class="tex-text">\(|5 v_{in}| \gt 500 mV or |v_{in}| \gt 100 mV\)</span>. The output offset error can be reduced by using a better operational amplifier, that is, one that guarantees smaller bias currents and input offset voltage.</p>
