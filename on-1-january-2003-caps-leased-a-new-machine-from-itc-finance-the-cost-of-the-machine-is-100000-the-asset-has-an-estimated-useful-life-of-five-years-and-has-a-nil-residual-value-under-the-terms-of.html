The asset has an estimated useful life of five years and has a nil residual value.

(a) This lease should be classified as a finance lease. There are clear indicators that the rights normally associated with ownership have been transferred from the lessor to the lessee:<br /> ● The minimum lease payments ($20,000 × 6) totalling $120,000 exceed the capital cost of the asset ($100,000).<br /> ● The lease term is three years and the useful life is estimated at 5 years, so the lease agreement is for the majority of the asset’s useful life.<br /> ● Should the asset be sold, 95 per cent of the proceeds would accrue to the lessee.<br /> ● A secondary term has been offered at a nominal rate below the market rate for leasing the asset.<br /> Remind yourself of the steps we used when dealing with a finance lease question. Refer back to the chapter text if necessary.<br /> (b) Step 1: Confirm classification as a finance lease – done in part (a).<br /> Step 2: Calculate the total finance charge:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="153"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89"></td> <td width="64">$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total repayments (6 × $20,000)</td> <td>120,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Capital cost of the asset</td> <td>100,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total interest to be allocated</td> <td>20,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Step 3: Establish the number of finance periods over which to allocate interest. There are six repayments but they are payable in advance so the last finance period has no outstanding liability as the final instalment payable on 1 July 2005 extinguishes the creditor<br /> balance. The lease term then continues to 31 December 2005. The finance periods total 6-1 = 5.<br /> Step 4: Calculate the interest to be charged to the periods. The question requires the use of the sum-of-digits method of allocating interest.<br /> Sum of digits = n(n+1)/2, where n is the number of finance periods<br /> Sum of digits = (5×6)/2 = 15</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="409"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89">Period</td> <td width="64">Capital at start</td> <td width="64">Payment</td> <td width="64">Outstanding during period</td> <td width="64">Interest to be allocated</td> <td width="64">Capital at end</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>$</td> <td>$</td> <td>$</td> <td>$</td> <td>$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/1/2003</td> <td>100,000</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>80,000</td> <td>20,000 × 5/15 = 6,667</td> <td>86,667</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/7/2003</td> <td>86,667</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>66,667</td> <td>20,000 × 4/15 = 5,333</td> <td>72,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/1/2004</td> <td>72,000</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>52,000</td> <td>20,000 × 3/15 = 4,000</td> <td>56,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/7/2004</td> <td>56,000</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>36,000</td> <td>20,000 × 2/15 = 2,667</td> <td>38,667</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/1/2005</td> <td>38,667</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>18,667</td> <td>20,000 × 1/15 = 1,333</td> <td>20,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1/7/2005</td> <td>20,000</td> <td>20,000</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>120,000</td> <td></td> <td>20,000</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Note: The full allocation is given above for illustration purposes only. In order to answer this question the calculation need only go as far as 1/7/04 – that is, to calculate the entries for 2003 and the creditor due within one year (i.e. payable in 2004) for part (c).<br /> The accounting entries for the year to 31 December 2003 are as follows:</p>
