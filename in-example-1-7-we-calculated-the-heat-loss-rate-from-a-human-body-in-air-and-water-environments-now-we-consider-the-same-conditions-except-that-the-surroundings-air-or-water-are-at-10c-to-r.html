            <p class="blog">In , we calculated the heat loss rate from a human body in air and water environments. Now we consider the same conditions except that the surroundings (air or water) are at 10 °C. To reduce the heat loss rate, the person wears special sporting gear (snow suit and wet suit) made from a nanostructured silica aerogel insulation with an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.014 W/m .K. The emissivity of the outer surface of the snow and wet suits is 0.95. What thickness of aerogel insulation is needed to reduce the heat loss rate to 100 W (a typical metabolic heat generation rate) in air and water? What are the resulting skin temperatures?</p>

 <p class="blog">
Find: Insulation thickness needed to reduce heat loss rate to 100 W and corresponding skin temperature.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assumptions:<br /> 1. Steady-state conditions.<br /> 2. One-dimensional heat transfer by conduction through the skin/fat and insulation layers.<br /> 3. Contact resistance is negligible.<br /> 4. Thermal conductivities are uniform.<br /> 5. Radiation exchange between the skin surface and the surroundings is between a small<br /> surface and a large enclosure at the air temperature.<br /> 6. Liquid water is opaque to thermal radiation.<br /> 7. Solar radiation is negligible.<br /> 8. Body is completely immersed in water in part 2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis: The thermal circuit can be constructed by recognizing that resistance to heat flow is associated with conduction through the skin/fat and insulation layers and convection and radiation at the outer surface. Accordingly, the circuit and the resistances are of the following form (with <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r}\)</span> = 0 for water):</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total thermal resistance needed to achieve the desired heat loss rate is found from Equation 3.19<span class="tex-text">\(R_{tot} =\sum{R_{t} } =\frac{\Delta T}{q} =\frac{1}{UA}\)</span> ,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(R_{tot} =\frac {T_{i} &#8211; T_{\infty }}{q} =\frac {(35 &#8211; 10)K} {100 W} = 0.25 K/W \)</span> <p class="blog">
The total thermal resistance between the inside of the skin/fat layer and the cold surroundings includes conduction resistances for the skin/fat and insulation layers and an effective resistance associated with convection and radiation, which act in parallel. Hence,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(R_{tot} =\frac{L_{sf} }{k_{sf} A} +\frac{L_{ins} }{k_{ins} A } +(\frac{1}{1/hA }+ \frac{1}{1/h_{r} A })^{-1} =\frac{1}{A} (\frac{L_{sf} }{k_{sf} } +\frac{L_{ins} }{k_{ins} }+\frac{1}{h + h_{r}} )\)</span> <p class="blog">
This equation can be solved for the insulation thickness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Air<br /> The radiation heat transfer coefficient is approximated as having the same value as in : <span class="tex-text">\( h_{r} = 5.9 W/m^{2} . K \)</span>.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(L_{ins}= k_{ins}[A R_{tot}-\frac{L_{sf} }{k_{sf} }-\frac{1}{h + h_{r}}] =0.014 W/m . K [1.8 m^{2}× 0.25 K/W &#8211; \frac{3 × 10^{-3} m }{0.3 W/m . K} &#8211; \frac{1}{(2 + 5.9) W/m^{2} . K}] = 0.0044 m = 4.4 mm\)</span> <p class="blog">
Water</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(L_{ins}= k_{ins}[A R_{tot}-\frac{L_{sf} }{k_{sf} }-\frac{1}{h }] = 0.014 W/m . K [1.8 m^{2}× 0.25 K/W -\frac{3 × 10^{-3} m }{0.3 W/m . K }-\frac{1}{200 W/m^{2} . K }] = 0.0061 m = 6.1 mm\)</span> <p class="blog">
These required thicknesses of insulation material can easily be incorporated into the snow and wet suits.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The skin temperature can be calculated by considering conduction through the skin/fat layer:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q = \frac{k_{sf} A (T_{i} &#8211; T_{s}) }{L_{sf}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
or solving for <span class="tex-text">\(T_{s}\)</span>,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(T_{s} = T_{i} &#8211; \frac{q L_{sf}}{ k_{sf} A} = 35 °C &#8211; \frac{100 W × 3 × 10^{-3} m}{ 0.3 W/m . K × 1.8 m^{2}} = 34.4 °C\)</span> <p class="blog">
The skin temperature is the same in both cases because the heat loss rate and skin/fat proper-ties are the same.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. The nanostructured silica aerogel is a porous material that is only about 5% solid. Its thermal conductivity is less than the thermal conductivity of the gas that fills its pores. As explained in Section 2.2, the reason for this seemingly impossible result is that the pore size is only around 20 nm, which reduces the mean free path of the gas and hence decreases its thermal conductivity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. By reducing the heat loss rate to 100 W, a person could remain in the cold environments indefinitely without becoming chilled. The skin temperature of 34.4 °C would feel comfortable.<br /> 3. In the water case, the thermal resistance of the insulation dominates and all other resistances can be neglected.<br /> 4. The convection heat transfer coefficient associated with the air depends on the wind conditions, and it can vary over a broad range. As it changes, so will the outer surface temperature of the insulation layer. Since the radiation heat transfer coefficient depends on this temperature, it will also vary. We can perform a more complete analysis that takes this into account. The radiation heat transfer coefficient is given by Equation 1.9:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(h_{r} = \varepsilon \sigma (T_{s,0} &#8211; T_{sur} )(T^{2}_{s,0} &#8211; T^{2}_{sur})\)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here <span class="tex-text">\( T_{s,0} \)</span> is the outer surface temperature of the insulation layer, which can be calculated from</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(T_{s,0} = T_{i} &#8211; q[\frac{L_{sf}}{k_{sf} A} + \frac{L_{ins}}{k_{ins} A}]\)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since this depends on the insulation thickness, we also need the previous equation for <span class="tex-text">\( L_{ins} \)</span>:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(L_{ins}= k_{ins}\left(A R_{tot}- \frac{L_{sf}}{k_{sf}}-\frac{1}{h + h_{r} } \right)\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
With all other values known, these three equations can be solved for the required insulation thickness. Using all the values from above, these equations have been solved for values of h in the range 0 ≤ h ≤ 100 <span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K\)</span>, and the results are represented graphically.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Increasing h reduces the corresponding convection resistance, which then requires additional insulation to maintain the heat transfer rate at 100 W. Once the heat transfer coefficient exceeds approximately 60 <span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K\)</span>, the convection resistance is negligible and further increases in h have little effect on the required insulation thickness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The outer surface temperature and radiation heat transfer coefficient can also be calculated. As h increases from 0 to 100 <span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K , T_{s,o}\)</span>decreases from 294 to 284 K, while <span class="tex-text">\( h_{r}\)</span> decreases from 5.2 to 4.9 <span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K\)</span>. The initial estimate of <span class="tex-text">\(h_{r} = 5.9 W/m^{2}.K\)</span>, was not highly accurate. Using this more complete model of the radiation heat transfer, with h = 2<span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K\)</span>, the radiation heat transfer coefficient is 5.1 <span class="tex-text">\(W/m^{2}.K\)</span>, and the required insulation thickness is 4.2 mm, close to the value calculated in the first part of the problem.<br /> 5. See Example 3.1 in IHT. This problem can also be solved using the thermal resistance network builder, Models/Resistance Networks, available in IHT.</p>
