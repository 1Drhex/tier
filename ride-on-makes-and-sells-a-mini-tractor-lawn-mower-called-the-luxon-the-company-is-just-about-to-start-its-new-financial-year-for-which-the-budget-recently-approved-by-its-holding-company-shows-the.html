The Luxon has a selling price of £2,500 but its new rival has been priced approximately £300 below this. After a hastily convened meeting, Ride-on’s top managers have decided to reduce the Luxon’s price to £2,150 with immediate effect. They also feel that their forecast sales revenue now looks optimistic.<br /> Tasks:<br /> Advise them how they might maintain their forecast return on capital employed (ROCE) at 20% now that the Luxon’s price has been reduced:<br /> a) if total sales revenue is maintained at £2.8 million; and<br /> b) if total sales revenue decreases to £2.5 million.</p>

Advice: As shown above, the budgeted full cost of the Luxon is £1,800. But as the selling price has been significantly decreased, a greater number will have to be sold to achieve the £800,000 forecast profit which is needed to maintain the ROCE at 20%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
● If total sales revenue can be maintained at £2.8 million (despite the price reduction to £2,150) and fixed costs cannot be reduced, the variable costs will have to be reduced by 14% to £688 per unit. This is a challenging target but may well be achievable.<br /> ● If total sales revenue decreases to £2.5 million in this very competitive market and fixed costs cannot be reduced, the variable costs will have to be reduced by 36% to £512 per unit. This is a huge task and is probably unachievable.<br /> The variable costs need to be re-examined with a view to their reduction. The mower should be re-engineered. For example, is it possible to use less costly components which still meet specifications? Is it possible to replace several parts with just one that will do the job? If so, resources will be saved in ordering, inspection, storage and fitting. Even if the full amount of savings cannot be made, the greater they are, the less will be the fall in their ROCE.<br /> The company would be well advised also to scrutinize its fixed overheads to see if any of these could be reduced. It is likely that some saving will be found, but less than the total amount needed. However, this would mean that the variable cost reduction target would diminish and so become more achievable.<br /> The best chance of receiving an annual bonus next year is to employ the technique of target costing/pricing to reduce variable costs by at least 14%. Also, the selling price reduction needs to be sufficient to increase volume by 16.25% ((1,302 − 1,120)/1,120). This will maintain sales revenue, net profit, the ROCE and the annual bonus!</p>
