1. Show that Alfredo has an incentive to put in the optimal number of hours. Alfredo works until his marginal cost—the opportunity cost of his time—equals the marginal benefit—the extra amount he gets if he wins at trial. Because he has already paid Pam, all extra amounts earned at trial go to Alfredo. Therefore, Alfredo has an incentive to put in the optimal number of hours.<br /> 2. Show that whether efficiency in risk bearing occurs depends on the parties’ attitudes toward risk. Alfredo bears all the risk related to the outcome of the trial. Thus, if he’s risk neutral and Pam is risk averse, this contract results in efficient risk bearing, but not otherwise.<br /> 3. Explain why the parties are hesitant to sign the contract because of asymmetric information and moral hazard. No matter how risk averse Pam is, she may hesitate to agree to this contract. Because she is not an expert on the law, she cannot easily predict the jury’s likely verdict. Thus, she does not know how large a fixed fee she should insist on receiving. They have no practical way in which Alfredo’s superior information about the likely outcome of the trial can be credibly revealed to her. She suspects that it is in his best interest to tell her that the likely payout is lower than he truly believes. Similarly, Alfredo may be hesitant to offer Pam a fixed fee. How well they do in court depends on the merits of her case. At least initially, Alfredo does not know how good a case she has. Initially,she has an incentive to try to convince him that the case is very strong.</p>
