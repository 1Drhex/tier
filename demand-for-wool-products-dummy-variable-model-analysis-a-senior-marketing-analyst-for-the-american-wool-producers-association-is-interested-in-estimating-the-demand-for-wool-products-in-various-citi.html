The analysis begins by placing each of the cities in one of the three regions. Figure 13.2 is a scatter plot of per capita sales versus disposable income. The data appear to be separated into three distinct subgroups corresponding to geographic regions. Two dummy variables are used to identify each of the three regions:</p>
 <p class="blog">
North: <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = 0, x_{3} = 1\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Central: <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = 1, x_{3} = 0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
South: <span class="tex-text">\(x_{2} = 0, x_{3} = 0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
In general, K distinct regions or subsets can be identified uniquely with K &#8211; 1 dummy variables. If we try to use K dummy variables to represent K distinct subsets, then a linear relationship between predictor variables will result, and estimation of coefficients will be impossible, as discussed in Section 12.2. This is sometimes referred to as the “dummy variable trap.”</p>
 <p class="blog">
Shifts in the model constant could be estimated using the following model:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}X_{2} + \beta _{3}X_{3} + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Applying this model to the north, it becomes</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(0\right) + \beta _{3}\left(1\right) + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \left(\beta _{0} + \beta _{3}\right) + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
In the central region we find the following:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(1\right) + \beta _{3}\left(0\right) + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \left(\beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\right) + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Finally, for the southern region the model is as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(o\right) + \beta _{3}\left(0\right) + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \beta _{0} + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Summarizing these results, the constants for the various regions are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
North: <span class="tex-text">\( \beta _{0} + \beta _{3}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Central: <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
South: <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{0}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This formulation defines the south as the “base” constant, with <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{3}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{2}\)</span> defining the shift of the function for northern and central cities, respectively. Hypothesis tests, using the coefficient Student’s t statistic, could be used to determine if there are significant differences between the constants for the different regions compared, in this case, to the constant for the southern region. For additional regions, constants could be modeled by using dummy variables that continue this pattern. We could specify the dummy variables so that any level would be the base level to which the other levels are compared. In this problem specifying the south as the base condition is natural, given the problem objectives.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The model with differences in slope coefficients and constants is as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}X_{2} +\beta _{3}X_{3} + \left(\beta _{1} +\beta _{4}X_{2}+ \beta _{5}X_{3}\right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}X_{2} +\beta _{3}X_{3} + \beta _{1}X_{1} +\beta _{4}X_{2}X_{1}+ \beta _{5}X_{3} X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Applying this model to the northern region, we see that</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(0\right) +\beta _{3}\left(1\right) + \left(\beta _{1} +\beta _{4}\left(0\right) + \beta _{5}\left(1\right) \right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \left(\beta _{0}+\beta _{3} \right) + \left(\beta _{1}+\beta _{5} \right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
For the central region the model is as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(1\right) +\beta _{3}\left(0\right) + \left(\beta _{1} +\beta _{4}\left(1\right) + \beta _{5}\left(0\right) \right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(= \left(\beta _{0}+\beta _{2} \right) + \left(\beta _{1}+\beta _{4} \right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
Finally, for the southern region</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y = \beta _{0} + \beta _{2}\left(0\right) +\beta _{3}\left(0\right) + \left(\beta _{1} +\beta _{4}\left(0\right) + \beta _{5}\left(0\right) \right)X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\beta _{0} + \beta _{1}X_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
The <span class="tex-text">\(X_{1}\)</span> slope coefficients for cities in different regions are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
North: <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{1} + \beta _{5}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Central: <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{1} + \beta _{4}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
South: <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{1}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Again, the south is the base condition with slope <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{1}\)</span>. Hypothesis tests can be used to determine the statistical significance of slope coefficient differences compared to the base condition—in this case the southern region. Using this dummy variable regression model, the analyst can estimate the relationship between sales and disposable income by region of the country.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the sample of 30 SMSAs divided equally among the three geographic regions, a dummy variable multiple regression model was estimated using Minitab. The results are contained in Figure 13.3. From the regression model we can determine characteristics of the wool purchase patterns. Conditional hypothesis tests of the form</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(H_{o} : \beta _{j} = 0 \mid \beta _{l} \neq 0, l = 1, &#8230; , K, l \neq j\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(H_{1} : \beta _{i} \neq 0 \mid \beta _{l} \neq 0, l = 1, &#8230; , K, l \neq j\)</span> <p class="blog">
can be used to determine the conditional effects of the various factors on the demand for wool. The coefficient for the <span class="tex-text">\(X_{3}\)</span> dummy variable, <span class="tex-text">\(\beta _{3}\)</span> = 138.46, indicates that people in the north spend an average of $138.46 more than people in the south. Similarly, people in the central region spend an average of $96.33 more than people in the south. These coefficients are each conditionally significant. The coefficient for disposable income is 0.0252, indicating that for people in the south, each dollar of increased per capita income increases the purchase of wool products by 0.025, and this result is conditionally significant. For people in the north, each dollar of increased income increases expenditure for wool products by 0.042 (0.0252 + 0.0168), and the difference in the increased slope is conditionally significant. The estimated rate of increase in purchase per dollar of increased income is also greater for people in the central region compared to the south. However, that difference is not conditionally significant. Using these results, sales by region can be predicted more precisely compared to a model that combines all regions and uses only per capita income.</p>
