            <p class="blog">Effects of Fiscal Factors on Housing Prices (Regression Model Coefficient Estimation)</p> <p class="blog">Northern City, Minnesota, was interested in the effect of local property development on the market price of houses in the city. Northern City is one of many small, nonmetropolitan, midwestern cities with populations in the range from 6,000 to 40,000. One of the objectives was to determine how increased commercial property development would influence the value of local housing. Data are stored in the data file Citydatr.</p>

To answer this question, data were collected from a number of cities and used to construct a regression model that estimates the effect of key variables on housing price. For this study the following variables were obtained for each city:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Y (hseval) = mean market price for houses in the city</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(X_{1}\)</span> (sizehse) = mean number of rooms in houses</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(X_{2}\)</span> (incom72) = mean household income</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(X_{3}\)</span> (taxrate) = tax rate per thousand dollars of assessed value for houses</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(X_{4}\)</span> (Comper) = percentage of taxable property that is commercial property</p>
 <p class="blog">
The multiple regression output, prepared using Minitab, is shown in Figure 12.9. The coefficient for the mean number of rooms in city houses is 7.878, with a coefficient standard deviation of 1.809. In this study housing values are in units of $1,000, with a mean of $21,000 over all cities. Thus, if the mean number of rooms in a city’s houses was larger by 1.0, then the mean price would be larger by $7,878. The resulting Student’s t statistic is 4.35 and the ρ-value is 0.000. Thus, the conditional hypothesis that this coefficient is equal to 0 is rejected. The same result occurs for the income and tax rate variables. The incom72 variable is in units of dollars, and, thus, if a city’s mean income is higher by $1,000, the coefficient of 0.003666 indicates that mean housing price will be $3,666 higher. If the tax rate increases by 1%, mean housing price is reduced by $1,718. We see that the regression analysis leads to the conclusion that each of these three variables is a significant predictor of the mean house price in the cities included in this study. However, we see that the coefficient for the percent of commercial property, Comper, is -10.614, with a coefficient standard deviation of 6.491, resulting in a Student’s t statistic equal to -1.64. Note that here is an important area for judgment. The coefficient would have a single-tail ρ-value of 0.053 or a two-tailed ρ-value of 0.106. Thus, it appears to have some effect in reducing the mean price of houses. Given that the effects of house size, income, and tax rate on the market price for houses have been included, we see that the percent of commercial property does not increase housing prices. Thus, the argument that the market value of houses will increase if more commercial property is developed is not supported by this analysis. That conclusion is true only for a model that includes these four predictor variables. Note also that the values of R² = 47.4% and <span class="tex-text">\(s_{e}\)</span> (standard error of the regression) = 3.677 are included in the regression output.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The advocates of increased commercial development also claimed that increasing the amount of commercial property would decrease the taxes paid on owneroccupied houses. This claim was tested using the regression output in Figure 12.10, prepared using Excel. The coefficient estimators and their standard errors are indicated. The Student’s t statistics for the size of house and the tax-rate coefficients are 2.65 and 6.36, indicating that these variables are important predictors. The Student’s t statistic for income is 1.83, with a p-value of 0.07 for a two tailed test. Thus, income has some influence as a predictor, but its effect is not as strong as the previous two variables. Again, we see a place for good judgment that considers the problem context. The conditional hypothesis that increased commercial property decreases taxes on owner-occupied houses can be tested using the conditional Student’s t statistic for the variable “Comper” in the regression output. The conditional Student’s t statistic is -1.03, with a p-value of 0.308. Thus, the hypothesis that increased commercial property does not decrease house taxes cannot be rejected. There is no evidence from this analysis that house taxes would be lowered if there was additional commercial development.</p>

Based on the regression analyses performed in this study, the consultants concluded that there was no evidence that increased commercial property would either increase the market value of houses or lower the property taxes for a house.</p>
