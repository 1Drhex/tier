            <p class="blog">E, a food retailer, decided to start a home delivery service from 1 November 2002. As E had no vehicles suitable for use by the new service, it purchased three small delivery vehicles to enable them to provide the service.</p> <p class="blog">The invoice for the vehicles included the following details:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="153"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89"></td> <td width="64">$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cost price – per vehicle</td> <td>12,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less: Trade discount</td> <td>2,400</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>9,600</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less: Trade discount</td> <td>250</td> </tr> <tr> <td>One vehicle</td> <td>9,850</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Three vehicles</td> <td>29,550</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 year’s insurance for the three vehicles</td> <td>2,100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total cost of three vehicles</td> <td>31,650</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">By 31 October 2003, there had been a general price increase in all new delivery vehicles of 25%. The directors of E decided to revalue the three delivery vehicles to 125% of their net book value at 31 October 2003.<br /> During the next year, it became apparent that the delivery service was so successful that the delivery vehicles were now too small. On 1 April 2004, E traded in the three delivery vehicles for three new larger vehicles. The new larger delivery vehicles cost $18,000 each and the vendor allowed a trade-in value of $9,000 for each of the old vehicles. E paid the<br /> balance of $9,000 per vehicle on 1 May 2004.<br /> All vehicles are depreciated using the reducing balance method at 25% per annum, charged on a time basis.<br /> E purchased new computer equipment, costing $5,000, to assist in running the delivery service.<br /> The software required to provide the service was also purchased at the same time. The initial cost of the delivery scheduling software was $950 plus the cost of adapting the software to E’s detailed specifications $2,600. The computer equipment and the adapted software were delivered on 1 November 2002, and brought into use at once. During December 2002, the software developed reliability problems, often crashing for no apparent reason. E’s in-house programmer spent time resolving these problems at an estimated cost of $2,000 in December 2002 and $1,000 in January 2003. E depreciates all computer equipment and software on a straight line basis over four years, assuming no residual value.<br /> IAS 16 – Property, plant and equipment describes the asset recognition process as:<br /> • Initial recognition<br /> • Subsequent remeasurement<br /> • Derecognition<br /> Requirements<br /> (i) Apply the IAS 16 asset recognition process to the above situations and explain the relevance of each stage of the process to each of the situations.<br /> (ii) Prepare income statement and balance sheet extracts for the years ended 31 October 2003 and 31 October 2004 to show how the above transactions would be recorded. Explain your treatment with reference to appropriate International Financial Reporting Standards.</p>

(i) Initial recognition – on purchase the attributable costs will be recognised. Delivery vehicles recognised at $29,550 ($9,850 × 3).<br /> Computers; the attributable cost is the cost of acquiring and getting the system ready for use or enabling it to become functional. This can include the initial adaptations but does not include the in house programmers as the work was done at a later stage and is regarded as an additional cost incurred. For any additional cost to be capitalised it must enhance or improve the asset beyond its original specification. The in house programmers were checking and fixing the software to get it up to its original specification, not enhancing beyond the original specification.<br /> Subsequently remeasured – the vehicles are subsequently remeasured when they are revalued on 31 October 2003.<br /> The computer system has no subsequent remeasurement.<br /> Derecognised – the vehicles are derecognised when they are traded in as E Ltd no longer has access to the risks and rewards of ownership. On derecognition the value received is deducted from their carrying value to calculate the loss on disposal.<br /> The computers are still in use and have not been derecognised.<br /> (ii) IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment requires the cost of the tangible non-current assets to be recognised. Cost includes delivery charge and is net of any trade discount. Annual running costs such as insurance are revenue expenditure and are charged to the income statement.<br /> IAS 16 allows tangible non-current assets to be revalued; any increase in value is credited to revaluation reserve.</p>
