This geometry can be studied using both two and three-dimensional approximations depending on the accuracy requirement and conditions. The boundary conditions used include uniform velocity at inlet (parallel to the walls), no-slip conditions on the walls, constant pressure at the exit and the wall temperature higher than that of the inlet fuid temperature. The Prandtl number used is 0.72 and the equations used are nondimensionalized using standard scales (see Chapter 7). Figure 9.7 (a) shows the unstructured finite element mesh used. Although the mesh selected is not fully converged for all Reynolds numbers, this is sufficient to demonstrate the procedure. A reasonably converged mesh is essential for practical design and analysis calculations. The results are generated for different Reynolds numbers and are shown in Figures 9.7,9.8 and 9.10 using one-equation, Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model (see Chapter 8).The sample contour plots in Figure 9.7 and 9.8 are given here to make sure that the results show an anticipated pattern. The stream lines in Figures 9.7(b) and 9.8(b) clearly show a recirculation immediately after the turn along the top wall. A small recirculating pattern is also visible at the bottom turn. Since the flow separation takes place ahead of the tum along the bottom surface, the flow slows down towards the turn. Thus, the heat transfer rate is expected to drop significantly towards the tum along the bottom wall. However, the opposite is true along the top wall before the turn. This is due to the fact that no flow separation exists along the top wall ahead of the turn. Beyond the turn, presence of a strong recirculation and flow separation along the top wall are expected to reduce the heat transfer rate. The heat transfer will recover beyond the reattachment points along both walls. These flow trends clearly influence the temperature distribution as shown in Figure 9.7(d) . As seen, the temperature contours are closely packed along the top wall all the way to the turn indicating a strong temperature gradient and rapid heat transfer. However, the temperature gradient is not consistently high all the way to the turn along the bottom wall. The temperature distribution along the bottom wall indicates a stronger heat transfer rate in the vicinity of the inlet and it reduces towards the turn. After the turn, the bottom wall recovers the high temperature gradient within a short distance from the turn while the top wall requires a longer distance to recover a high gradient in temperature. These trends are clearly shown by the local Nusselt number distribution in Figure 9.9. It is also important to note the adverse pressure gradients in Figure 9.7(c) at both the top and bottom recirculations. The average Nusselt number and pressure drop variations with Reynolds number are shown in Figure 9.10. As expected the Nusselt number increases with Reynolds numbers on both walls. The value is almost identical on both walls to a Reynolds number of 1000 . Beyond Re=1000, the average Nusselt number on the top wall is higher than at the bottom wall. This is due to the fact that the recirculation zone at the top wall reduces in size with increase in Reynolds number and allows the Nusselt number to recover back to a higher value within a short distance from the turn as shown by the local Nusselt number distributions in Figure 9.9. The Nusselt number variation with Reynolds number shows a nonlinear pattern. The nondimensional pressure drop <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta p / \rho u_{\infty}^{2}\right)\)</span> reduces as the Reynolds number is increased.</p>
