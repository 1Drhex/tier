<strong>Given:</strong> (a) option 1 and (b) option 2.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Compare buying QCOM stock with buying QCOM with a protective put.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>(a) Option 1:</strong> Buy QCOM at $76.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If stock is bought at $76 per share, the investor begins to lose money as soon as the stock drops below the purchase price. The entire $76 purchase price is at risk.</p>
 <ul> <li><strong>Upside potential:</strong> If the price increases, the investor benefits from the entire increase without incurring the cost of the put premium or insurance.</li> <li><strong>Downside risk:</strong> When only the stock is bought, there is no protection or insurance. The investor is at risk of losing the entire investment.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
<strong>(b) Option 2:</strong> Buy QCOM at $76 and buy a QCOM $75-put contract.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A six-month put with a strike price of $75 can be bought for $4.40 or $440 per contract ($4.40 <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 100). This put can be considered insurance “with a $1 discount,” because the stock is purchased at $76 and an “at-the-money” put with the strike price ($75) is purchased. If the stock drops below $75, the put or insurance will begin to offset any loss in QCOM (less the cost of the put). If QCOM remains at $75 or above, the put will expire worthless and the premium will be lost. If just the stock had been bought, the investor would begin to profit as soon as the stock rose above $76. However, the investor would have no protection from the risk of the stock declining in value. Owning a put along with stock ensures limited risk while increasing the break-even on the stock by the cost of the put—still allowing for unlimited profit potential above the break-even.</p>

The only disadvantage is that the investor will not begin to profit until the stock rises above $80.40.</li> <li><strong>Downside risk:</strong> No matter how low QCOM falls, buying the six-month put with a 75-strike price gives the investor the right to sell QCOM at $75 up until expiration. The downside risk is only $5.40, which is the total cost for this position—$<br /> 80.40 less $75 (the strike price). Figure 13.7 shows the profit pattern for a long position in a stock combined with a long position in a put.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> If you buy QCOM $70 put (at $2.45 premium) instead of $75 put, your behavior is viewed as if you want some downside protection on a stock position but are willing to have a deductible in exchange for a lower insurance cost. The potential volatility of the equity markets can be of great concern to investors. The purchase of a protective put can give the investor the comfort level needed to purchase individual securities. This strategy is actually more conservative than purchasing stock. As long as a put is held against a stock position, there is limited risk; you know where the stock can be sold. The only disadvantages are that money cannot be made until the stock moves above the combined cost of the stock and the put, and that the put has a finite life. Once the stock rises above the total cost of the position, however, an investor has the potential for unlimited profit.</p>
