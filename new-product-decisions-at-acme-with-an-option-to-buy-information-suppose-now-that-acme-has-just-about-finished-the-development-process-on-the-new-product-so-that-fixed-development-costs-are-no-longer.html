            <p class="blog">New Product Decisions at Acme with an Option to Buy Information<br /> Suppose now that Acme has just about finished the development process on the new product, so that fixed development costs are no longer an issue, and technological failure is no longer a possibility. The only question is whether Acme should market the product, given the uncertainty about the eventual sales volume. If the company decides to market the product, it will incur fixed marketing costs of $2 million. To keep the model simple, we now assume that there are only two possible market outcomes, good or bad. The sales volumes for these two possible outcomes are 600,000 units and 100,000 units, and Acme assesses that their probabilities are 0.4 and 0.6. However, before making the ultimate decision, Acme has the option to hire a well-respected marketing research firm for $150,000. If Acme decides to use this option, the result will be a prediction of good or bad. That is, the marketing research firm will predict that either “We think the market for this product will<br /> be good” or “We think the market for this product will be bad.” Acme has used this firm before, so it has a sense of the prediction accuracy, as indicated in Table 9.1. Each row in this table indicates the actual market outcome, and each column indicates the prediction. So if the actual market is good, the prediction will be good with probability 0.8 and bad with probability 0.2. If the actual market is bad, the prediction will be bad with probability 0.7 and good with probability 0.3. What should Acme do to maximize its EMV?</p> <p class="blog">Table 9.1 Prediction Accuracy of Marketing Research Firm:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 349px; height: 83px;" border="0" width="216" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Bad</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Good</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Actual/Predicted</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">0.2</td> <td dir="LTR">0.8</td> <td dir="LTR">Good</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">0.7</td> <td dir="LTR">0.3</td> <td dir="LTR">Bad</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use a decision tree to see whether the marketing research firm is worth its cost and whether the product should be marketed.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The main question here concerns the probabilities. Acme’s assessment of the probabilities of good or bad markets, 0.4 and 0.6, would be assessed as in earlier examples, probably subjectively. The probabilities in Table 9.1 are probably based partly on historical dealings with the marketing research firm—perhaps they have been right in about 75% of their predictions, give or take a bit—and some subjectivity. In any case, all of these probabilities are prime candidates for sensitivity analysis.</p>

Acme must first decide whether to hire the marketing research firm. If it decides not to, it can then immediately decide whether to market the product. On the other hand, if it decides to hire the firm, it must then wait for the firm’s prediction. After the prediction is received, Acme can then make the ultimate decision on whether to market the product. However, when making this ultimate decision, Acme should definitely take the firm’s prediction into account.<br /> A “skeleton” for the appropriate decision tree, without any of the correct probabilities or monetary values, appears in Figure 9.15. For now, just focus on the structure of the tree, and how time flows from left to right. Note how the tree is not symmetric. If Acme doesn’t hire the firm, this “No” decision branch is followed immediately by another decision node for whether to market the product. However, if Acme does hire the firm, this “Yes” decision branch is followed by a probability node for the firm’s prediction. Then after a good or a bad prediction, there is a decision node for whether to market the product.<br /> Now it is time to label the tree with probabilities and monetary values. The monetary values present no problems, as will be seen shortly. However, the probabilities require a digression so that we can discuss Bayes’ rule. The problem is that the given probabilities in Table 9.1 are not the probabilities required in the tree. After we discuss Bayes’ rule, we will return to Acme’s decision problem.</p>

<strong>Bayes’ Rule: Frequency Approach</strong><br /> Bayes’ rule, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes from the 1700s, is a formal mathematical mechanism for updating probabilities as new information becomes available. The general idea is simple, as illustrated in Figure 9.16. The original probabilities are called prior probabilities. Then information is observed and Bayes’ rule is used to update the prior probabilities to posterior probabilities. As the diagram indicates, the terms prior and posterior are relative. If later information is observed, the posterior probabilities in the middle play the role of priors. They are used, along with Bayes’ rule, to calculate new posterior probabilities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<div class="image-clearfix"> <img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/9.16-2-300x45.png"></div></p>
 <p class="blog">
The actual updating mechanism can be done in two ways: with frequencies (counts) or with probabilities. We (and our students) believe that the frequency approach is much easier to understand, so we will present it first. But because the probability approach is useful for spreadsheet calculations, we will present it as well.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider the following situation. During a routine physical exam, a middle-aged man named Joe tests positive for a certain disease. There were previously no indications that Joe had this disease, but the positive test sends him into a panic. He “knows” now that he has the disease. Or does he? Suppose that only 1% of all undiagnosed middle-aged men have this disease. Also, suppose the test Joe took is not entirely accurate. For middle-aged men who don’t have the disease, there is a 10% chance they will test positive. For middleaged men who have the disease, there is a 5% chance they will test negative. So with a positive test result, what are the chances that Joe has the disease?</p>
 <p class="blog">
A frequency approach starts with a large number, say 10,000, of middle-aged men and follows them according to the stated percentages. A diagram of this appears in Figure 9.17 and in the file Bayes Rule for Disease Finished.xlsx. The percentages on the links are the given percentages, and the number in each box is the percentage times the number in the box above it. We know that Joe’s status is in one of the two lightly shaded boxes because he tested positive. Therefore, the probability that he has the disease, that is, the probability that his status is in the leftmost box, is 95/(951990), or about 8.75%.</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
We suspect that you are quite surprised by this low posterior probability. If so, you’re not alone. Highly trained physicians, when posed with this same problem, have given widely ranging answers—almost the entire range from 0% to 100%. Essentially, they might as well be throwing darts. The problem is that we humans don’t have very good intuition about probabilities. However, there are two simple reasons why Joe’s posterior probability of having the disease is as low as it is. First, not many men in his age group, only 1%, have the disease. Therefore, we tend to believe that Joe doesn’t have the disease unless we see convincing evidence to the contrary. The second reason is that this test has fairly large error rates: 10% false positives and 5% false negatives. Therefore, the evidence from the test is not entirely convincing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What if Joe tested negative? Then using the same numbers in the diagram, his posterior probability of having the disease would drop quite a lot from the prior of 1%. Specifically, it would be 5/(518910), or about 0.06%. We were fairly sure he didn’t have the disease before the test (because only 1% of his age group has it), and a negative test result convinces us even more that he doesn’t have the disease.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One final calculation that will become useful in Acme’s problem appears at the bottom of Figure 9.17. This is the probability that Joe tests positive in the first place. (In general, it is the probability of any potential piece of information.) Of the 10,000 men, 95+990 test positive, so this probability is (95+990)/10000, or about 10.9%. As you can see, most of these are false positives.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This frequency approach is quite straightforward, even though it often yields surprising and unintuitive results. You are asked to apply it to several other scenarios in the problems. For now, we apply it to Acme’s problem in Example 9.3. The prior probabilities of good or bad markets are 40% and 60%. The probabilities for the accuracy of the predictions are given in Table 9.1. From these, we can follow 1000 similar products and predictions, exactly as we did with Joe’s disease. (We use 1000 rather than 10,000 for variety. The number chosen doesn’t influence the results at all.) The diagram appears in Figure 9.18. As you can see, the probability of a good market increases from 40% to 64% with a good prediction, and it decreases to 16% with a bad prediction. Also, the probability that the prediction will be good is 50%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You should be aware that three complementary probabilities are implied by the probabilities shown. For example, after a good prediction, the market will be either good or bad, so the posterior probability of a bad market is 36%. Similarly, the posterior probability of a bad market after a bad prediction is 84%, and the probability of a bad prediction is 50%. If you like this frequency approach for updating probabilities, you can keep using it. It is a perfectly acceptable way to update probabilities as information is received, and it is equivalent to a more formal use of Bayes’ rule, which we now present.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Bayes’ Rule: Probability Approach</strong><br /> First, we need some notation. For any possible outcome O, we let P(O) be the probability of O. This implicitly indicates the probability of O occurring, given all the information currently available. If we want to indicate that new information, I, is available, we write the probability as P(O|I). This is called a conditional probability. The vertical bar is read “given that,” so this is the probability of outcome O, given that we have observed information I.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The typical situation is that there are several outcomes such as “good market” and “bad market.” In general, we denote these outcomes as <span class="tex-text">\(O_{1}\)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\(O_{n}\)</span>, assuming there are n possibilities. Then we start with prior probabilities P(<span class="tex-text">\(O_{1}\)</span>) to P(<span class="tex-text">\(O_{n}\)</span>), n probabilities that sum to 1. Next, we observe new information, I, such as a market prediction, and we want the posterior probabilities P(<span class="tex-text">\(O_{1}\)</span>|I) to P(<span class="tex-text">\(O_{n}\)</span>|I), an updated set of n probabilities that sum to 1. We assume that the “opposite” conditional probabilities, P(I|<span class="tex-text">\(O_{1}\)</span>) to P(I|<span class="tex-text">\(O_{n}\)</span>), are given. In Bayesian terminology, these are called likelihoods. These likelihoods are the accuracy probabilities in Table 9.1. For example, one of these is the probability of seeing a good prediction, given that the market will be good.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Unfortunately, these likelihoods are not what we need in the decision tree. Because time goes from left to right, we first need the (unconditional) probabilities of possible predictions and then we need the posterior probabilities of market outcomes, given the predictions (see Figure 9.15). So Bayes’ rule is a formal rule for turning these conditional probabilities around. It is given in Equation (9.1).</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Bayes’ Rule:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P(O_{i}|I)=\frac {P(I|O_{i})P(O_{i})}{P(I|O_{1})P(O_{1}) + … + P(I|O_{n})P(O_{n})}\)</span> (9.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In words, Bayes’ rule says that the posterior is the likelihood times the prior, divided by a sum of likelihoods times priors. As a side benefit, the denominator in Bayes’ rule is also useful in multistage decision trees. It is the probability P(I) of the information outcome.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Denominator of Bayes’ Rule (Law of Total Probability):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P(I) = P(I|O_{1})P(O_{1}) + … + P(I|O_{n})P(O_{n})\)</span> (9.2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This formula is important in its own right. For I to occur, it must occur along with one of the O’s. Equation (9.2) simply decomposes the probability of I into all of these possibilities. It is sometimes called the law of total probability.<br /> In the case where there are only two O’s, labeled as O and Not O, Bayes’ rule takes<br /> the following form:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Bayes’ Rule for Two Outcomes:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P(O|I ) = \frac {P(I|O )P(O )}{P(I|O)P(O) + P(I|Not O)P(Not O)}\)</span> (9.3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Implementing Bayes’ Rule for Acme These formulas are actually fairly easy to implement in Excel, as shown in Figure 9.19 for the Acme problem. (See the file New Product Decisions – Information Option Finished. xlsx.) First, it is important to be consistent in the use of rows and columns for the outcomes (the O’s) and the predictions (the I’s). If you examine Figure 9.19 closely, we have always put the Good/Bad labels for market outcomes down columns, and we have always put the Good/Bad labels for predictions across rows. You could just as well do it in the opposite way, but you should be consistent. This allows you to copy formulas. Note that the given probabilities, the priors and the likelihoods, are in the left section, columns B and C. The Bayes’ rule calculations are in the right section, columns G and H.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We first implement Equation (9.2) in cells G7 and H7. The formula in cell G7, a sum of likelihoods times priors, is<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B14:B15,$B$9:$B$10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and this can be copied to cell H7. Next, we implement Equation (9.3) in the range G11:H12 to calculate the posteriors. Each is a likelihood times a prior, divided by one of the sums in row 7. The formula in cell G11 is<br /> =B14*$B9/G$7<br /> and because of the careful use of relative/absolute addresses, this can be copied to the range G11:H12. Note that the “Sum checks” indicate which probabilities should sum to 1. Fortunately, this procedure is perfectly general. If you always enter outcomes down columns and information across rows, the same essential formulas given here will always work. Of course, you can check that these Bayes’ rule calculations give the same results as the frequency approach in Figure 9.18.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Completing the Acme Decision Tree</strong><br /> Now that we have the required probabilities, we can label Acme’s decision tree from Figure 9.15 with monetary values and probabilities. The completed tree appears in Figure 9.20. You should examine this tree carefully. The cost of hiring the marketing research firm is entered when the hiring takes place, in cell B28, the fixed cost of marketing the product is entered when the decision to market occurs, in cells D20, D32, and C44, and the net revenues are entered in the branches to the right as before. As for probabilities, the priors are entered in the bottom section of the tree, the part where the marketing research firm is not hired. Then the probabilities of the predictions are entered in column C (they just happen to be 50-50), and the posterior probabilities are entered in column E. Of course, all of these entries are cell references to the inputs and calculations in Figure 9.19.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As before, once all of the monetary values and probabilities are entered in the tree, PrecisionTree automatically performs all of the folding-back calculations, as you can see in Figure 9.20. Then you can follow the TRUEs. In this case, the marketing research firm is evidently too expensive for the level of accuracy it provides, so according to EMV, Acme should not hire the firm. Instead, it should market the product immediately. The EMV from this strategy is $3.4 million. On the other hand, if Acme were forced to hire the marketing research firm, its best strategy would be to market the product regardless of the firm’s prediction. (Follow the TRUEs in column D.) The EMV from this strategy would be only $3.25 million. This discussion leads naturally to a digression on the value of information.</p>

<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> Making Sequential Decisions<br /> Whenever you have a chance to make several sequential decisions and you will learn useful information between decision points, the decision you make initially depends on the decisions you plan to make in the future, and these depend on the information you will learn in the meantime. In other words, when you decide what to do initially,<br /> you should look ahead to see what your future options will be, and what your decision will be under each option. Such a contingency plan is typically superior to a myopic (short-sighted) plan that doesn’t take into account future options in the initial decision making.</p>

<strong>The Value of Information</strong><br /> In a decision-making context, information is usually bought to reduce the uncertainty about some outcome. The information always comes with a price tag, in this case $150,000, and the question is whether the information is worth this much. Alternatively, the question is how much you would be willing to pay for the information. In some situations, as in the Acme problem with the given inputs, the answer is clear. This marketing research is worth nothing to Acme. It is not even worth $1, let alone $150,000. Do you see why? The key is that Acme will make the same decision, market the product, regardless of the prediction the marketing research firm makes. Essentially, Acme will ignore the firm’s prediction, so it makes no sense for Acme to pay for a prediction it intends to ignore.</p>
 <p class="blog">
makes no sense for Acme to pay for a prediction it intends to ignore. The reason the marketing research firm’s prediction is worthless is partly because it’s inaccurate and partly because marketing continues to be better than not marketing even when the probability of a bad market is high. In other words, it would take a really bad market prediction to persuade to Acme not to market. However, to indicate what could happen, we will double the fixed marketing cost from $2 million to $4 million. As shown in Figure 9.21, this changes everything. Now the fixed cost more than offsets the possible gain from a good market unless the probability of a good market is fairly high—64% and 40% are high enough, but 16% isn’t. In this case, the marketing research firm should be hired for $150,000, and then Acme should market the product only if it hears a good prediction.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this case, we know that the marketing research firm is worth its $150,000 price, but how much would Acme be willing to pay to hire the firm. This amount is called the expected value of information, or EVI, and it is given by Equation (9.4)<span class="tex-text">\(.^{6}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The EVI is the most you would be willing to pay for the information.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equation for EVI<br /> EVI = EMV with (free) information – EMV without information (9.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The calculation of EVI is quite easy, given the completed decision tree in Figure 9.21. The 1630 value in cell C28 (really $1.63 million) is Acme’s net EMV after paying $150,000 to the firm. If Acme could get this information for free, its EMV would be 1630 + 150, or $1.78 million. On the other hand, the bottom section of the tree shows that Acme’s EMV with no information is $1.4 million. Therefore, according to Equation (9.4), EVI is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">EVI = 1.78 &#8211; 1.4 = 0.38, or $380,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
In other words, the marketing research firm could charge up to $380,000, and Acme would still be willing to hire them. You can prove this to yourself. With the fixed marketing cost still at $4 million, change the cost of the hiring the firm to $379,000. The decision tree should still have a TRUE for the hiring decision. Then change the cost to $381,000. Now there should be a FALSE for the hiring decision.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although the calculation of EVI is straightforward once the decision tree has been created, the decision tree itself requires a lot of probability assessments and Bayes’ rule calculations. These can be difficult, depending on the type of information available. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to ask how much any information could be worth, regardless of its form or accuracy. The result is called the expected value of perfect information, or EVPI, and it is given by Equation (9.5).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The EVPI is the most you would be willing to pay for perfect information.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equation for EVPI<br /> EVPI = EMV with (free) perfect information – EMV without information (9.5)</p>
 <p class="blog">
To calculate EVPI for the Acme problem, forget about the marketing research firm and its possible prediction. All we have is the bottom of the tree, which uses Acme’s prior probabilities of market outcomes. (We will continue to assume that the fixed marketing cost is $4 million, so that Figure 9.21 is appropriate.) So Acme’s EMV with no information is $1.4 million. To find the EMV with free perfect information, imagine that Acme will be told, truthfully, whether the market will be good or bad before the marketing decision has to be made. With probability 0.4, the prior probability, it will be told “good,” and with probability 0.6, it will be told “bad.” If it knows the market will be good, it should market the product because the net payoff is 10,800 from sales minus 4000 for the fixed cost, or $6.8 million, a positive value. On the other hand, if it knows the market will be bad, it should not market the product because this would lead to a net payoff of 1800 from sales minus 4000 for the fixed cost, which is less than the 0 value it could get from not marketing the product. Therefore, according to Equation (9.5), EVPI is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">EVPI = (0.4)(6.8) + (0.6)(0) &#8211; 1.4 = $1.32 million</p>
 <p class="blog">
In words, no information, regardless of its form or accuracy, could be worth more than $1.32 million to Acme. This calculation is often performed because it is easy and it provides an upper limit on the value of any information. As we saw, however, some information, such as the marketing research firm’s prediction, can be worth considerably less than $1.32 million. This is because the firm’s predictions are not perfect.<br /> Let’s make the EVPI calculation once more, for the original problem where the fixed marketing cost is $2 million. In this case, the value of the market research firm was 0, but will EVPI also be 0? The answer is no. Referring to the bottom section of Figure 9.20, the calculation is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">EVPI = (0.4)*Max(10.8-2,0) + (0.6)*Max(1.8-2,0) &#8211; 3.4 = (0.4)(8.2) + (0.6)(0) &#8211; 3.4 = $0.12 million</p>
 <p class="blog">
Each “Max” in this equation indicates the best of marketing and not marketing, and the second max is 0 because the fixed marketing cost is greater than the sales revenue if the market is bad.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this case, Acme shouldn’t pay anything for the marketing research firm’s information, but other types of information could be worth up to $0.12 million. The intuition here is the following. The marketing research firm’s information is worthless because Acme will ignore it, marketing the product regardless of the information. But perfect information is worth something because Acme will act one way, market the product, if the information is good, and it will act another way, don’t market the product, if the information is bad. Presumably, other types of imperfect information could have the same effect and hence be worth something, but they can’t be worth more than $0.12 million.</p>

<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> The Value of Information<br /> The amount you should be willing to spend for information is the expected increase in EMV you can obtain from having the information. If the actual price of the information is less than or equal to this amount, you should purchase it; otherwise, the information is not worth its price. In addition, information that never affects your decision is worthless, and it should not be purchased at any price. Finally, the value of any information can never be greater than the value of perfect information that would eliminate all uncertainty.</p>

<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> We have already performed one sensitivity analysis, simply by changing the fixed marketing cost in cell B5 from $2 million to $4 million and seeing how the tree changes. You can perform any number of similar “ad hoc” sensitivity analyses in this way, provided that the entries in the tree are linked to the input section of your worksheet. But you might also like to perform a more formal sensitivity analysis with PrecisionTree’s powerful tools. We will show the results of several such sensitivity analyses, each with the fixed marketing cost set to $4 million. (We won’t provide the step-by-step details of how to perform these in PrecisionTree, but if you need help, you can watch the Quick Start step 5 video we referenced earlier.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first sensitivity analysis is on the prior probability, currently 0.4, of a good market. To do this, you should first change the value in cell B10 so that it is a formula, =1−B9.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(See Figure 9.22.) The reason is that as the probability in cell B9 varies, we want probability in cell B10 to vary accordingly. (In general, if you want to perform a sensitivity analysis on a probability, you should use formulas to guarantee that the relevant probabilities continue to sum to 1. In the file for this example, you will see that there are also formulas in cells C14 and C15 for this same purpose.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The strategy region graph in Figure 9.23 shows how Acme’s EMVs from hiring and not hiring the firm vary as the prior probability of a good market varies from 0.2 to 0.6. Acme wants the largest EMV, which corresponds to the Yes line for small probabilities (up to about 0.48) and the No line for large probabilities. Why would Acme hire the firm only when the prior probability of a good market is small? The reason is that this is when the firm’s predictions are most helpful. On the right side of the graph, Acme is already fairly sure that the market is good, so the marketing research firm’s predictions in this case are less useful. Of course, the value of a sensitivity analysis such as this is that your intuition might not be so good. It tells you what you might not have been able to figure out on your own.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you fill out PrecisionTree’s Sensitivity Analysis dialog box, you can choose a “starting node” other than the “Entire Model.” We repeated the analysis by choosing cell D36 as the starting node. (See Figure 9.21.) The idea here is that Acme has already decided to hire the firm and has then seen a bad prediction. The strategy region graph in Figure 9.24 shows the EMVs from marketing and not marketing the product, from this point on, as the prior probability of a good market varies as before.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As you can see, Acme should not market the product after a bad prediction unless the prior probability of a good market is approximately 0.55 or higher. Of course, this makes intuitive sense.<br /> In one final sensitivity analysis, a two-way analysis, we let the prior probability of a good market vary as before, and we let the fixed marketing cost vary from 25% below to 25% above its current value of $4 million. Also, we choose “Entire Model” as the starting node. The results are shown in Figure 9.25. The blue diamonds correspond to input values where Acme should hire the firm, and the red triangles correspond to input values where Acme shouldn’t hire the firm. The pattern indicates that hiring is best only when the fixed marketing cost is high and/or the prior probability of a good market is low. For example, if the prior probability of a good market is 0.5, the Acme should hire the firm only if its fixed marketing cost is $4.2 million or above. As another example, if Acme’s fixed marketing cost is $3.8 million, it should hire the firm only if the prior probability of a good market is 0.4 or below.<br /> One of the most important benefits of using PrecisionTree is that once you have built the decision tree, you can quickly run any number of sensitivity analyses such as the ones shown here. They often provide important insights that help you better understand the decision problem. You are asked to perform other sensitivity analyses on this example (and ) in the problems.</p>
