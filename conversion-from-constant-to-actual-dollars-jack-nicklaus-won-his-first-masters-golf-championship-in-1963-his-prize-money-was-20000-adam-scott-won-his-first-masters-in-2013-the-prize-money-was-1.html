<strong>Given:</strong> Two prize monies received in 1963 and 2013, respectively.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Compare these two prizes in terms of purchasing power of 2013.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Both prize monies are in actual dollars at the time of winning. So, if we want to compare the prizes on the basis of the purchasing power of the year 2013, then we need to know the consumer price indexes for 1963 as well as 2013.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the old CPI, we find that the CPI for 1963 is 91.7 and the CPI for 2013 is 697.8. The average annual inflation rate between these two periods is 4.14%. To find the purchasing power of Nicklaus’s $20,000 in 2013, we simply calculate the expression</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(20,000\left(1 + 0.0414\right) ^{50} =\$152,023\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Given inflation and the changing value of money, $20,000 in 1963 is equivalent to $152,023 in terms of 2013 purchasing power. This is clearly much lower than Adam’s actual 2013 winning prize, but Jack had 50 years to invest the amount to match Adam’s winning prize. Then, at what interest rate would Jack’s earning in 1963 match the prize money in 2013?</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\$20,000\left(1 + i\right) ^{50} =\$1,440,000\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">i = 8.93%</p>
