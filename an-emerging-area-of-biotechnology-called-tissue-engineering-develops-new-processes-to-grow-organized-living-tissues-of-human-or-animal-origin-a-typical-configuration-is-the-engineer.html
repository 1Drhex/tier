Living tissues require oxygen to stay alive. The mass transport of oxygen (<span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span>) to the tissue is an important design consideration. One potential system is schematically illustrated in Figure. Thin tubes arranged on a triangular pitch pass longitudinally through the tissue bundle. The tubes serve as a “scaffold” for supporting the living tissue matrix and supply oxygen and nutrients to the tissue at the same time. Let us focus on a single <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> delivery tube with tissue surrounding it, as illustrated in Figure. Pure oxygen (<span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span>) gas flows through the tube. The tube wall is extremely permeable to <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span>, and the <span class="tex-text">\( O_{2} \)</span> partial pressure through the porous tube wall can be taken as the <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> partial pressure inside the tube. Oxygen is only sparingly soluble in the tissue, which is mostly water. The concentration of dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> at <span class="tex-text">\( r = R_{1}, \)</span> is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A s} = \frac{p_{A}}{H} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
where H is the Henry’s law constant for the dissolution of <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> in living tissue at the process temperature and <span class="tex-text">\( p_{A} \)</span> is the partial pressure of <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> in the tube. The dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> diffuses through the tissue and is metabolically consumed. The metabolic consumption of dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> is described by a kinetic rate equation of the form</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A} = &#8211; \frac{R_{A, \max } c_{A}}{K_{A} + c_{A}} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This important rate equation for biological systems, called the Michaelis–Menten equation, arises from complex interactions of the reactant substrate (species A) with enzymes that catalyze the conversion of A to products. However, this simple equation adequately describes the reaction kinetics of many biological processes. In this relationship,<span class="tex-text">\( K_{A} \)</span> is the binding constant of the substrate to the enzyme(s) of interest with units of concentration, and <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A, \max } \)</span> is the maximum possible reaction rate once the biologically mediated reaction has become saturated by the substrate. There are two limiting cases. First, if <span class="tex-text">\( K_{A} &lt;&lt; c_{A} \)</span>, which occurs at high substrate concentrations or for substrates with a high affinity to the enzyme(s) of interest, the reaction does not depend on <span class="tex-text">\( C_{A} \)</span>, and so <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A} \doteq R_{A, \max } \)</span>, i.e., is zero-order with respect to <span class="tex-text">\( C_{A} \)</span>. In the second limiting case, <span class="tex-text">\( K_{A} &gt;&gt; c_{A} \)</span>, so that</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A} = &#8211; \frac{R_{A, \max } c_{A}}{K_{A} + c_{A}} = &#8211; \frac{R_{A, \max }}{K_{A}} c_{A}=-k_{1} c_{A} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
and so the reaction is first order with respect to <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A} \)</span>.<br /> A key parameter in the design of the engineered tissue bundle is the spacing between the tubes. If the tube spacing is too wide, the dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> concentration will go to near zero and starve the tissue. Therefore, it is important to know the radial concentration profile, <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A}(r) \)</span> of dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span>. Develop a differential model to predict <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A}(r). \)</span> The physical system possesses cylindrical geometry, and the following assumptions for model development are listed here. (1) The source for <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> mass transfer is the pure <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> gas inside the tube, and the sink for mass transfer is the metabolic consumption of dissolved oxygen by the tissue. If the <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> partial pressure <span class="tex-text">\( P_{A} \)</span> is maintained constant inside the tube along longitudinal coordinate z, then the flux of oxygen through the tissue is one-dimensional along the radial (r) direction. (2) Tissue remains viable and maintains constant physical properties. (3) The <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> transfer process is at steady state. (4) The tissue is stationary, and the dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> concentration is dilute. (5) At <span class="tex-text">\( r = R_{1} \)</span>, the tube material is thin and highly permeable to <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> so that the dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> concentration in the tissue is in equilibrium with the <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> partial pressure in the tube. (6) At <span class="tex-text">\( r = R_{2} \)</span>, there is no net flux of <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The general differential equation for mass transfer in cylindrical coordinates is</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; \left(\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r N_{A, r}\right) + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial N_{A, \theta}}{\partial \theta}+\frac{\partial N_{A, z}}{\partial z}\right) + R_{A} = \frac{\partial c_{A}}{\partial t} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
For steady-state one-dimensional flux along the r direction, the general equation for mass transfer reduces to</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r N_{A, r}\right) + R_{A} = 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
For a one-dimensional system, the partial derivatives can be replaced with ordinary derivatives. Alternatively, we can perform a material balance for dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> on the differential element of volume <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \pi L r \Delta r \)</span> shown in Figure and get the same result. Specifically, for steady-state one-dimensional flux along the r direction with a homogeneous reaction <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A} \)</span> within the differential volume element, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \left.2 \pi L r N_{A r}\right|_{r=r}-\left.2 \pi L r N_{A r}\right|_{r = r+\Delta r}+R_{A} 2 \pi L r \Delta r = 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Diving through by <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \pi L \Delta r \)</span>, and rearranging, we get</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; \left(\frac{\left.r N_{A, r}\right|_{r=r+\Delta r} &#8211; \left.r N_{A, r}\right|_{r=r}}{\Delta r}\right)+R_{ A } r=0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, taking the limits as <span class="tex-text">\( \Delta r \rightarrow 0 \)</span> yields</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d r}\left(r N_{A r}\right) + R_{A} = 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
For one-dimensional flux of dissolved <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> through the stagnant tissue in cylindrical coordinates along the r direction, Fick’s flux equation reduces to</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( N_{A, r} = &#8211; D_{A B} \frac{d c_{A}}{d r}+\frac{c_{A}}{c}\left(N_{A, r}\right) = &#8211; D_{A B} \frac{d c_{A}}{d r} \)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
because <span class="tex-text">\( O _{2} \)</span> is only sparingly soluble in the tissue so that <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A} &lt;&lt; c \)</span>, where c is the total molar concentration of the tissue, which approximates the molar concentration of water. In cylindrical geometry, <span class="tex-text">\( N_{A, r} \)</span> is not constant along diffusion path r, because (a) cross-sectional area for flux is increasing along r and (b) the <span class="tex-text">\( R_{A} \)</span> term is present. As a result, the flux equation cannot be integrated. It is now necessary to combine Fick’s flux equation and the differential equation for mass transfer in order to get the concentration profile</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( &#8211; \frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d r}\left( &#8211; r D_{A B} \frac{d c_{A}}{d r}\right) + R_{A} = 0 \)</span> <p class="blog">

&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The concentration profile <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A}(r) \)</span> is now expressed as a second-order differential equation. Therefore, two boundary conditions on <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A}(r) \)</span> must be specified:</p>
 <p class="blog">
at</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( r = R_{1}, \left.N_{A, r}\right|_{r=R_{1}} = 0 = &#8211; \left.\left.D_{A B} \frac{d c_{A}}{d r}\right|_{r=R_{1}} \quad \therefore \frac{d c_{A}}{d r}\right|_{r=R_{1}}=0 \)</span> <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
The analytical solution for <span class="tex-text">\( c_{A}(r) \)</span> and its extension to predicting the overall rate of oxygen consumption in the tissue bundle has been left.</p>
