His rich, generous uncle has agreed to loan him $80,000 at an annually compounded interest rate of 4% per year. John will pay back his uncle the accumulated sum F on the fifth loan anniversary.

<span class="fontstyle0">Thus, John pays back his uncle on the fifth loan anniversary a sum of $97,332. For the second part of the answer, we refer to, and compare with, Example 1.1 where for simple interest was considered. In Example 1.1, John paid back $3,200 four times and $83,200 once as the last payment. So the total payment under simple interest was ($3,200</span><span class="fontstyle2">× </span><span class="fontstyle0">4) + $83,200 = $96,000. Since his payment under compound interest is $97,332, compounding earned his uncle $1,332 more ($97,332 – $96,000). This $1,332 represents the additional interest earned due to compounding. We thus see that compounding benefits the lender (obviously a cost to the borrower!).</span></p>
