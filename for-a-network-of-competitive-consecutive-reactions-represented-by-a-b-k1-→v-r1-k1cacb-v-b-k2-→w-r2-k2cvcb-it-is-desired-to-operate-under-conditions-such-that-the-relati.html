Figures 9.10 and 9.11 are useful for determining the conversion level at which each type of reactor should be operated. The locus of points along which the relative overall yield V is 75% is given by the straight line linking the point <span class="tex-text">\(f_{A}=0,C_{V}/C_{A0}=0\)</span> to the point <span class="tex-text">\(f_{A}=1,C_{V}/C_{A0}=0.75\)</span>. Points above this straight line will correspond to yields in excess of the minimum specified value of 75%. The point where this straight line intersects the yield curve for the specified value of <span class="tex-text">\(k_{2}/k_{1}\)</span> (1.0) indicates the highest conversion level at which the product distribution specified can be achieved. When such a straight line is superimposed on Figure 9.10, one finds that for a batch or plug flow reactor, the maximum possible conversion of A that is consistent with the constraint on the product distribution is <span class="tex-text">\(f_{A}=0.42\)</span>. For a CSTR the corresponding maximum conversion level may be found using Figure 9.11. For this case <span class="tex-text">\(f_{A}=0.25\)</span>. At the conversion levels indicated, the product mixtures will contain substantial amounts of unreacted A and B. Thus, it is appropriate to consider the questions of separation and recycle for each species in turn.</p>

Reactant A</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
If A has significant economic value, it should be separated from the reactor effluent stream and recycled for subsequent reuse. Since the conversion level is higher in the plug flow reactor, the recycle rate will be much smaller and the demands on the separation equipment for reclaiming species A will also be somewhat smaller. Even when species A is of relatively little economic value, there may be circumstances when the costs associated with meeting the pollution control requirements for the process effluent will dictate separation and recycle of this reactant as the most economic alternative.</p>

 <p class="blog">
Reactant B</p>
 <p class="blog">
The product distribution is insensitive to the concentration of reactant B. If B is cheap and does not create a potential pollution problem downstream, its concentration may be kept at any convenient level. However, if B is costly or must be removed for other reasons, one has the options of operating with low concentrations of B at high conversions thereof in a relatively large reactor to produce a product containing very little B, or of operating at higher concentrations of B in a smaller reactor with separation and recycle of unused B. The specified product distribution requires that the mole ratio of V to W be 3 : 1. To produce 1mol of W and 3mol of V, one must consume 4 mol of A and 5mol of B. The feed ratio employed in an actual situation may differ appreciably from 1.25 to enhance the reaction rate or to allow for recycling or discarding some A and B.</p>

Products V and W</p>
 <p class="blog">
Recycle of species V orWhas no merit, although there are a variety of reasons why it might be necessary to separate these materials from the product mixture: product purity specifications, pollution constraints, and so on, Neither product enhances the reaction rate. The low conversion of A that we are forced to employ is a consequence of the fact that otherwise there would be insufficient V in the product mixture.</p>
