            <p class="blog">ESTIMATING SENSITIVITY OF DEMAND TO PRICE AT THE LINKS COMPANY</p> <p class="blog">The Links Company sells its golf clubs at golf outlet stores throughout the United States.The company knows that demand for its clubs varies considerably with price. In fact,the price has varied over the past 12 months, and the demand at each price level has been observed. The data are in the data sheet of the file Golf Club Demand.xlsx (see Figure 2.26). For example, during the past month, when the price was $390, 6800 sets of clubs were sold. (The demands in column C are in hundreds of units. The cell comment in cell C3 is a reminder of this.) The company wants to estimate the relationship between demand and price and then use this estimated relationship to answer the following questions:<br /> 1. Assuming the unit cost of producing a set of clubs is $250 and the price must be a multiple of $10, what price should Links charge to maximize its profit?<br /> 2. How does the optimal price depend on the unit cost of producing a set of clubs?<br /> 3. Is the model an accurate representation of reality?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Business Objectives</strong> To estimate the relationship between demand and price, and to use this relationship to find the optimal price to charge.<br /> <strong>Excel Objectives</strong> To illustrate Excel’s Trendline tool, and to illustrate conditional formatting.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/2.26-1.png"></div>

This example is divided into two parts: estimating the relationship between price and demand, and creating the profit model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Estimating the Relationship between Price and Demand<br /> A scatterplot of demand versus price appears in Figure 2.27. (This can be created in the usual way as an Excel scatter chart.) Obviously, demand decreases as price increases, but the goal is to quantify this relationship. Therefore, after creating this chart, right-click any point on the chart to bring up the dialog box in Figure 2.28. This allows you to superimpose several different curves (including a straight line) on the scatterplot. We consider three possibilities, the <strong>linear</strong>, <strong>power</strong>, and <strong>exponential</strong> curves, defined by the following</p>
 <p class="blog">
general equations (where y and x, a general output and a general input, correspond to demand and price for this example):<br /> ■ Linear: <span class="tex-text">\(y = a + bx\)</span><br /> ■ Power: <span class="tex-text">\(y = ax^{b}\)</span><br /> ■ Exponential: <span class="tex-text">\(y = ae^{bx}\)</span><br /> Before proceeding, we describe some general properties of these three functions because of their widespread applicability. The linear function is the easiest. Its graph is a straight line. When x changes by 1 unit, y changes by b units. The constant a is called the intercept, and b is called the slope.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The power function is a curve except in the special case where the exponent b is 1. (Then it is a straight line.) Assuming that a is positive, the shape of this curve depends</p>
 <p class="blog">
primarily on the exponent b. If b&gt; 1, y increases at an increasing rate as x increases. If 0 &lt; b &lt;1, y increases, but at a decreasing rate, as x increases. Finally, if b &lt; 0, y decreases as x increases. An important property of the power curve is that when x changes by 1%, y changes by a constant percentage, and this percentage is approximately equal to b%. For example, if <span class="tex-text">\(y = 100x{-2.35}\)</span>, then every 1% increase in x leads to an approximate 2.35% ecrease in y.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The exponential function also represents a curve whose shape depends on the constant b in the exponent. Again, assume that a is positive. Then if b &gt;0, y increases as x increases; if b &lt; 0, y decreases as x increases. An important property of the exponential function is that if x changes by 1 unit, y changes by a constant percentage, and this percentage is approximately equal to 100 3 b%. For example, if <span class="tex-text">\(y = 100e{-0.014x}\)</span>, then whenever x increases by 1 unit, y decreases by approximately 1.4%. Here, e is the special number 2.7182 . . . , and e to any power can be calculated in Excel with the EXP function. For example, you can calculate <span class="tex-text">\(e{-0.014}\)</span> with the formula =EXP(−0.014).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Returning to the example, if you superimpose any of these curves on the scatterplot of demand versus price, Excel chooses the best-fitting curve of that type. In addition, if you check the Display Equation on Chart option, you see the equation of this best-fitting curve. Doing this for each type of curve gives the results in Figures 2.29, 2.30, and 2.31. (The equations might not appear exactly as in the figures. However, they can be resized and reformatted to appear as shown.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Each of these curves provides the best-fitting member of its “family” to the demand/price data, but which of these three is best overall? You can answer this question by finding the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for each of the three curves. To do so, for any price in the data set and any of the three curves, first predict demand by substituting the given price into the equation for the curve. The predicted demand is typically not the same as the observed demand, so you can calculate the absolute percentage error (APE) with the general formula:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(APE=\frac {\left|Observed\ demand &#8211; Predicted\ demand)\right|}{Observed\ demand}\)</span> (2.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then for any curve, MAPE is the average of these APE values. The curve with the smallest MAPE is the best fit overall.<br /> MAPE is a popular error measure, but it is not the only error measure used. Another popular error measure is RMSE (root mean squared error), the square root of the average of the squared errors. Another possible measure is MAE (mean absolute error), the average of the absolute errors. (MAE is sometimes called MAD, mean absolute deviation.) These three measures often, but not always, give the same rankings of fits, so any of them can be used, and all three are calculated in this example. However, the advantage of MAPE is that it is easy to interpret a value such as 5.88%: the fitted values are off, on average, by 5.88%. The values of RMSE and MAE are more difficult to interpret because they depend on the units of the observations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The calculations appear in Figure 2.32. After (manually) entering the parameters of the equations from the scatterplots into column B, you can proceed as follows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1 Predicted demands. Substitute observed prices into the linear, power, and exponential functions to obtain the predicted demands in columns E, F, and G. Specifically, enter the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$B$19+$B$20*B4<br /> 5$B$22*B4^$B$23<br /> and<br /> =$B$25*EXP($B$26*B4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cells E19, F19, and G19, and copy them down their respective columns.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2)Average percentage errors, MAPE. Apply Equation (2.1) to calculate APEs in columns H, I, and J. Specifically, enter the general formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ABS($C42E19)y$C4</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell H19 and copy it to the range H19:J30. (Do you see why column C is made absolute? Remember that this is where the observed demands are stored.) Then average the APEs in each column with the AVERAGE function to obtain the MAPEs in row 32.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Other error measures. Calculate the squared errors in columns K, L, and M by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=(E192$C4)^2</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell K19 and copying it to the range K19:M30. Then calculate the RMSEs in row 32 by taking the square roots of averages of each column. Similarly, calculate the absolute errors in columns N, O, and P by entering the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=ABS(E192$C4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell N19 and copying it to the range N19:P30. Then calculate the MAEs in row 32 by taking averages of each column.<br /> As you can see, the three error measures provide the same rankings, with the power fit being best according to all three. In particular, MAPE for the power curve is 5.88%, meaning that its predictions are off, on average, by 5.88%. This power curve predicts that each 1% increase in price leads to an approximate 1.9% decrease in demand. (Economists call this relationship elastic—demand is quite sensitive to price.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Developing the Profit Model<br /> Now we move to the profit model, using the Figure 2.33 as a guide. (See the file Golf Club Demand Big Picture.xlsx.) The profit model is straightforward to develop using the following steps (see Figure 2.34).</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Predicted demand. Calculate the predicted demand in cell B14 with the formula<br /> =B4*B11^B5<br /> This uses the power function that was estimated earlier.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 Revenue, cost, profit. Enter the following formulas in cells B15, B16, and B17:<br /> =B11*B14<br /> =B8*B14<br /> and<br /> =B15-B16</p>
 <p class="blog">
The assumption here is that the company produces exactly enough sets of clubs to meet customer demand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Maximizing Profit<br /> To see which price maximizes profit, you can build the data table shown in Figure 2.35. Here, the column input cell is B11 and the linking formula in cell B25 is =B17. The corresponding scatterplot shows that profit first increases and then decreases. You can find the maximum profit and corresponding price in at least three ways. First, you can attempt to read them from the chart. Second, you can scan down the data table for the maximum profit, which is shown in the figure. The following Excel Tip describes a third method that uses some of Excel’s more powerful features.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Conditional Formatting<br /> Cell B39 in Figure 2.35 is colored because it corresponds to the maximum profit in the column, but Excel’s Conditional Formatting tool can do this for you—automatically. To color the maximum profit, select the range of profits, B26:B47, click the Conditional Formatting dropdown arrow, then Top/Bottom Rules, and then Top 10 Items to bring up the dialog box in Figure 2.36. By asking for the top 1 item, the maximum value in the range is colored. You can experiment with the many other Conditional Formatting options. This is a great tool.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What about the corresponding best price, shown in cell B21 of Figure 2.35? You could enter this manually, but wouldn’t it be nice if you could get Excel to find the maximum profit in the data table, determine the price in the cell to its left, and report it in cell B21, all automatically? This is indeed possible. Just enter the formula =INDEX(A26:A47,MATCH(B20,B26:B47,0),1)<br /> in cell B21, and the best price appears. This formula uses two Excel functions, MATCH and INDEX. MATCH compares the first argument (the maximum profit in cell B20) to the range specified in the second argument (the range of profits) and returns the index of the cell where a match appears. (The third argument, 0, specifies that you want an exact match.) In this case, the MATCH function returns 14 because the maximum profit is in the 14th cell of the profits range. Then the INDEX function is called effectively as =INDEX(A26:A47,14,1). The first argument is the range of prices, the second is a row index, and the third is a column index. Very simply, this function says to return the value in the 14th row and first column of the prices range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To learn more about these functions, you can click the <span class="tex-text">\(f_{x}\)</span> button and examine the functions in the Lookup &amp; Reference category. After experimenting, you can see that the INDEX and MATCH combination solves the problem. You don’t have to memorize these functions, although this combination really does come in handy. Rather, you can often solve a problem by investigating some of Excel’s less well-known features. You don’t even need a manual—everything is in online help.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Sensitivity to Variable Cost<br /> We now return to question 2 in the example: How does the best price change as the unit variable cost changes? You can answer this question with a two-way data table. Remember that this is a data table with two inputs—one along the left side and the other across the top row—and a single output. The two inputs for this problem are unit variable cost and unit price, and the single output is profit. The corresponding data table is in the range A55:F83, shown in Figure 2.37. To develop this table, enter desired inputs in column A and row 55, enter the linking formula =B17 in cell A55 (it always goes in the top-left corner of a two-way data table), select the entire table, select Data Table from the What-If Analysis dropdown list, and enter B8 as the Row Input cell and B11 as the Column Input cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As before, you can scan the columns of the data table for the maximum profits and enter them (manually) in rows 51 and 52. (Alternatively, you can use the Excel features described in the previous Excel Tip to accomplish these tasks. Take a look at the finished version of the file for details. This file also explains how conditional formatting is used to color the maximum profit in each column of the table.) Then you can create a chart of maximum profit (or best price) versus unit cost. The chart in Figure 2.37 shows that the maximum profit decreases, but at a decreasing rate as the unit cost increases.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Limitations of the Model<br /> Question 3 asks you to step back from all these details and evaluate whether the model is realistic. First, there is no real reason to restrict golf club prices to multiples of $10. This was only required so that a data table could be used to find the profit-maximizing price. Ideally,you should search over all possible prices to find the profit-maximizing price. Fortunately, Excel’s built-in Solver tool enables you to accomplish this task fairly easily. The problem of finding a profit-maximizing price is an example of an optimization model. In optimization</p>
 <p class="blog">
models, you try to maximize or minimize a specified output cell by changing the values of the decision variable cells. Chapters 3 to 8 contain a detailed discussion of optimization models.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A second possible limitation of the model is the implicit assumption that price is the only factor that influences demand. In reality, other factors, such as advertising, the state of the economy, competitors’ prices, strength of competition, and promotional expenses, also influence demand. In Chapter 13, you will learn how to use multiple regression to analyze the dependence of one variable on two or more other variables. This technique allows you to incorporate other factors into the model for profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A final limitation of the model is that demand might not equal sales. For example, if actual demand for golf clubs during a year is 70,000 but the company’s annual capacity is only 50,000, the company will observe sales of only 50,000. This will cause it to underestimate actual demand, and the curve-fitting method will produce biased predictions. (Can you guess the probable effect on pricing decisions?)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Other Modeling Issues<br /> The layout of the Golf Club Demand Finished.xlsx file is fairly straightforward. However, note that instead of a single worksheet, there are two worksheets, partly for logical purposes and partly to reduce clutter. There is one worksheet for estimation of the demand function and the various scatterplots, and there is another for the profit model. One last issue is the placement of the data tables for the sensitivity analysis. You might be inclined to put these on a separate Sensitivity worksheet. However, Excel does not allow you to build a data table on one worksheet that uses a row or column input cell from another worksheet. Therefore, you are forced to put the data tables on the same worksheet as the profit model.</p>
