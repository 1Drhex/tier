The new product you are considering introducing is Press-on Abs. You feel you can sell 100,000 of these per year for 4 years (after which time this project is expected to shut down because forecasters predict looking healthy will no longer be in vogue and looking like a couch potato will). The Press-on Abs would sell for $6.00 each, with variable costs of $3.00 for each one produced. Annual fixed costs associated with production would be $90,000. In addition, a $200,000 initial capital expenditure would be associated with the purchase of new production equipment. It is assumed that this initial expenditure will be depreciated, using the simplified straight-line method, down to zero over 4 years. The project will also require a one-time initial investment of $30,000 in net working capital associated with the inventory. Finally, assume that the firm’s marginal tax rate is 35 percent. What are the free cash flows to the firm?</span></p>

<span class="fontstyle0">STEP 1: </span><span class="fontstyle0">Formulate a Solution Strategy<br /> </span><span class="fontstyle2">In general, a project’s free cash flows will fall into one of three categories: (1) the initial outlay, (2) the annual free cash flows over the project’s life, or (3) the terminal cash flow. Let’s begin by calculating the initial outlay.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">STEP 2: </span><span class="fontstyle0">Crunch the Numbers</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0"><br /> Initial Outlay<br /> </span><span class="fontstyle2">In this example, the initial outlay is the $200,000 initial capital expenditure plus the investment of $30,000 in net working capital, for a total of $230,000.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle2"><br /> </span><span class="fontstyle0">Annual Free Cash Flows<br /> </span><span class="fontstyle2">Table 11-1 calculates the annual change in earnings before interest and taxes. This calculation begins with the change in sales (Δ Sales) and subtracts the changes in fixed and variable costs in addition to the change in depreciation, to arrive at the change in</span> <span class="fontstyle0">earnings before interest and taxes (Δ EBIT). Depreciation is calculated using the simplified straight-line method, which is simply the depreciable value of the asset ($200,000) divided by the asset’s expected life of 4 years. Taxes are then calculated assuming a 35 percent marginal tax rate. Once we have calculated EBIT and taxes, we don’t need to go any further because these are the only two values from the income statement that we need. In addition, in this example there is no annual increase in working capital associated with the project under consideration. Also notice that we have ignored any interest payments and financing flows that might have occurred. As mentioned earlier, when we discount the free cash flows back to the present at the required rate of return, we are implicitly accounting for the cost of the funds needed to support the project.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The project’s annual change in operating cash flow is calculated in Table 11-2. Remember: </span><em><span class="fontstyle2">The project’s annual free cash flow is simply the change in operating cash flow less any change in net working capital and less any change in capital spending</span><span class="fontstyle0">.</span></em></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Terminal Cash Flow</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle2">For this project, the terminal cash flow is quite simple. The only unusual cash flow at the project’s termination is the recapture of the net working capital associated with the project. In effect, the investment in inventory of $30,000 is liquidated when the project is shut down in 4 years.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Keep in mind that in calculating free cash flow we subtract out the change in net working capital, but because the change in net working capital is negative (we are reducing our investment in inventory), we are subtracting a negative number, which has the effect of adding it back in. Thus, working capital was a negative cash flow when the project began and we invested in inventory, but at termination it becomes a positive offsetting cash flow when the inventory is liquidated. The calculation of the terminal free cash flow is illustrated in Table 11-3.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">STEP 3: </span><span class="fontstyle0">Analyze Your Results<br /> </span><span class="fontstyle2">In this example, there are no changes in net working capital and capital spending over the life of the project. This is not the case for all projects that you will consider. For example, on a project for which sales increase annually, it is likely that working capital will also increase each year to support a larger inventory and a higher level of accounts receivable. Similarly, on some projects the capital expenditures may be spread out over several years. The point here is that what we are trying to do is look at the firm with this project and without this project and measure the change in cash flows other than any interest payments and financing flows that might occur.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">If we were to construct a free cash flow diagram from this example (Figure 11-1), it would have an initial outlay of $230,000, the free cash flows during years 1 through 3 would be $154,000, and the free cash flow in the terminal year would be $184,000.</span></p>
