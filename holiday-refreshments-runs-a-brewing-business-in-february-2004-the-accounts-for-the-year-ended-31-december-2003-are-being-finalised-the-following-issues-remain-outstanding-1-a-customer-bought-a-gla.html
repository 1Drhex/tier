            <p class="blog">Holiday Refreshments runs a brewing business. In February 2004 the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2003 are being finalised. The following issues remain outstanding:<br /> 1. A customer bought a glass of Holiday Best Beer in his local bar during October 2003 and became ill. He is suing the bar and Holiday Refreshments. The case has not yet come to court and although the entity’s solicitors believe they will win the case, the directors offered an out-of-court settlement of $10,000 as a goodwill gesture. Under the terms of the offer each side would meet their own costs which in the case of Holiday Refreshments are $1,500 up to December 2003. All of this amount had been paid by the year-end. The customer has not yet formally accepted the offer.<br /> 2. A consignment of hops costing $95,000 was delivered to the brewery on 20 December 2003. The supplier has not yet issued an invoice. 3. Bottles for the entity’s beers are supplied by Bottlebank. Five years ago, in order to secure supplies, Holiday gave a guarantee over a $3,000,000 10-year bank loan taken out by Bottlebank. The guarantee is still in force. Bottlebank’s latest accounts indicate net assets of $6.8m and it has not breached any of the terms and conditions of the loan.</p> <p class="blog">4. Due to a faulty valve, a batch of beer was inadvertently discharged into a river instead of into the bottling plant in March 2003. The entity paid a fine of $20,000 in July 2003 for an illegal discharge. It is also responsible for rectifying any environmental damage. To 31 December 2003 $200,000 had been paid. The extent of further expenditure is uncertain<br /> although it is estimated to be between $100,000 and $140,000.<br /> Requirement<br /> Explain how each of the above items should be treated in the accounts of Holiday Refreshments for the year to 31 December 2003.</p>

1. Court case. An offer has been made but not yet accepted. It is uncertain whether it must be accepted or whether the customer will pursue his case. The offer arose out of a past event (supply of beer in October) and there is a present obligation as an offer has been made. A provision of $10,000 should be made and brief details disclosed.<br /> 2. Hops. This is a straightforward accrual. An obligation arises from a past event and there is no significant uncertainty.<br /> 3. Guarantee. No present obligation exists as Bottlebank has net assets and has met the terms of the loan. There is a possibility that the guarantee will be called in during the next 5 years and therefore the granting of the guarantee (a past event) may give rise to a possible obligation. This is a contingent liability which should be disclosed in the notes to the accounts but not provided for in the accounts.<br /> 4. Environmental discharge. The damage occurred as a result of a past event – the discharge of beer. The fine and $200,000 rectification costs will already be included in the accounts. There is an obligation to make good further environmental damage. There is uncertainty concerning the amount. A provision should be made of, say, $120,000, with an explanation of the range of possible payments.</p>
