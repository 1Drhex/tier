            <p class="blog">Z Industries is an operating subsidiary of a large quoted entity. Group management makes use of net current asset and liquidity ratios to evaluate period-end balance sheets. There is concern that the control exercised by Z Industries over its working capital is less than adequate.<br /> The parent entity establishes targets for inventories, trade receivables and payables and monitors how the subsidiary achieves those targets. For Z Industries it expects:<br /> (i) inventories to be no more than 10 per cent of sales;<br /> (ii) trade receivables to be equal to no more than 2.5 months’ credit sales;<br /> (iii) payables to be equal to no less than 2.5 months’ purchases.<br /> Cash is subject to control limits. Money is put on short-term deposit when holdings exceed 110 per cent of target. This target is the residual arrived at by reference to group norms for the net current assets ratio after the targets referred to above have been applied. When cash holdings drop below 90 per cent of target, withdrawal is made from interestbearing accounts to meet the target holding.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) to discuss what shortcomings are inherent in the adoption of the above criteria;<br /> (b) to explain how the setting of a working capital target based on actual revenue may be more or less appropriate than that based on a forecast;<br /> (c) to suggest how trade receivables’ balances may be monitored more appropriately.</p>

(a) The approach described is typical of the way one layer of management in an entity has, traditionally, monitored the layer below. It avoids the limitations of rigid budgets, in that working capital targets are adjusted to reflect the actual level of activity. Provided it is positioned as ‘attention-directing’ information, and not ‘decision support’, some argue it is still a worthwhile process. Where there are valid reasons for actual beingdifferent from the targets (often referred to as flexed budgets), it is argued, they can be identified and explained.<br /> All too often, however, the management style of an entity results in ratios and budgets becoming straitjackets, and more attention is paid to avoiding variances (including valid ones) than doing what is right for the business. Specifically, in this case, the limitations of the target are that they are a snapshot in time, and oriented to that point in time, or the recent past. Decision-making, the positive part of control, is essentially<br /> dynamic and forward-looking.<br /> Specifically:</p>
 <p class="blog">
● though inventories can be related to past sales, for monitoring purposes, they exist in anticipation of forecast sales, and are influenced by the considerations that comprise the economics of order quantities (essentially the balancing of the cost of holding them against the loss consequent upon their absence);<br /> ● though trade receivables can be compared with a yardstick related to current sales, the operative policy can only be expressed in terms of credit limits and periods, which may vary from customer to customer, as part of the marketing mix. Actual trade receivables will also be affected be previous periods’ sales not yet cleared;<br /> ● likewise, payables may be compared with a figure derived from sales, but in practice they are determined by receipts, and are heavily influenced by the precise date of receipt. Too much concentration on managing the balance sheet (i.e. to the point of window dressing) can damage the profitability of a business, through increases in both direct and indirect costs;<br /> ● the important consideration, when deciding how to deal with a cash surplus or shortage, depends on likely cash needs in the future.<br /> (b) The essence of accountability is the comparison of actual outturns with forecasts made, and agreed by the appropriate authority, at the appropriate time. This weighs heavily in favour of using a forecast as the basis for controlling working capital. Indeed, any other approach risks more heat than light being created in the monitoring process, with the lower layer setting out to demonstrate that the reason for the variance was an inappropriate target. It follows that the target should not be simple multiples of forecast sales, but should take into account changes in product mix, customer mix, and opportunities to improve profits by being more flexible as regards the balance sheet (e.g. increasing inventory ahead of a price increase). There was a time when the calculation task would be too great, but the advent of microcomputers, capable of being programmed by the users, has made it possible in the smallest of businesses.<br /> The time frame, and the frequency of the forecast, are important. There is no point in imposing arbitrary accounting periods on the process; the business lead times are what count. Also, it is important not to skimp the variance analysis. If the comparison is with a genuine forecast, then the variances will provide important information which needs to be fed back into the decision-making process. This is a very fast-changing area. As demand becomes more volatile, the costs of holding inventory and work in progress increase; many entities are looking to put their production on to something approaching a just-in-time basis, which makes forecasting more difficult, but more important. Updating management accounting systems to reflect this trend is a priority task in many businesses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) As mentioned in the previous section, the essence of monitoring is to compare what actually happens with what was, at the appropriate time, forecast to happen. Creditpolicies (limits and periods) will have been arrived at by assessing their impact on volume, margins, etc. The next step is to apply that to forecast sales, so as to help build up a cash-flow forecast. But credit control is largely about whether customers pay to terms.<br /> Again, before the advent of interactive computing facilities, this probably meant browsing through the sales ledgers every so often, hoping to spot any overdue items. Today it is possible to mark entries in the sales ledger with the expected date of payment. As receipts are accounted for, they are matched with the marks, and a list produced of customers who should have paid but have not. Open access to the information enables a higher level of authority to see what is happening, but this should be on a ‘look, but don’t touch’ basis if the accountability and motivation of the lower level are to be maintained. If the higher layer wishes to have an attention directing statistic, it would be well advised to adopt a backward accumulation approach, that is, calculating how many days’ sales have to be added together to reach the trade receivables figure.<br /> Perhaps the main point here, and it is applicable to many areas of the management accountant’s work, is that information technology is making it possible to get away from arbitrary periodic assessments and into customised and continuous monitoring.</p>
