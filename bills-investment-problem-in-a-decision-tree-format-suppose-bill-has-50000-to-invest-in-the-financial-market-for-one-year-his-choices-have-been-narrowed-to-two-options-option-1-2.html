            <p class="blog">Bill’s Investment Problem in a Decision-Tree Format</p> <p class="blog">Suppose Bill has <span class="tex-text">\(\$50,000\)</span> to invest in the financial market for one year. His choices have been narrowed to two options:</p> <p class="blog">• Option 1. Buy 1,000 shares of a technology stock at <span class="tex-text">\(\$50\)</span> per share that will be held for one year. Since this is a new initial public offering (IPO), there is not much research information available on the stock; hence, there will be a brokerage fee of $100 for this size of transaction (for either buying or selling stocks). For simplicity, assume that the stock is expected to provide a return at any one of three different levels: a high level (A) with a 50% return <span class="tex-text">\((\$25,000)\)</span>, a medium level (B) with a <span class="tex-text">\(9\%\)</span> return <span class="tex-text">\((\$4,500)\)</span>, or a low level (C) with a <span class="tex-text">\(30\%\)</span> loss <span class="tex-text">\((- \$15,000)\)</span>. Assume also that the probabilities of these occurrences are assessed at <span class="tex-text">\(0.25 , 0.40\)</span>, and <span class="tex-text">\(0.35\)</span>, respectively. No stock dividend is anticipated for such a growth-oriented company.</p> <p class="blog">• Option 2. Purchase a <span class="tex-text">\(\$50,000\)</span> U.S. Treasury bond, which pays interest at an effective annual rate of <span class="tex-text">\(7.5\% (\$3,750)\)</span>. The interest earned from the Treasury bond is nontaxable income. However, there is a <span class="tex-text">\(\$150\)</span> transaction fee for either buying or selling the bond.</p> <p class="blog">Bill’s dilemma is which alternative to choose to maximize his financial gain. At this point, Bill is not concerned about seeking some professional advice on the stock before making a decision. We will assume that any long-term capital gains will be taxed at <span class="tex-text">\(20\%\)</span>. Bill’s minimum attractive rate of return is known to be <span class="tex-text">\(5\%\)</span> after taxes. Determine the payoff amount at the tip of each branch.</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.17(a)\)</span> shows the costs and revenues on the branches, transformed to their present equivalents.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Option 1</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. With a <span class="tex-text">\(50\%\)</span> return (a real winner) over a one-year holding period,</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The net cash flow associated with this event at Period 0 will include the<br /> amount of investment and the brokerage fee. Thus, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
Period 0:<span class="tex-text">\( 1- \$50,000 &#8211; \$1002 = -\$50,100\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• When you sell stock, you need to pay another brokerage fee. However, any investment expenses, such as brokerage commissions, must be included in determining the cost basis for investment. The taxable capital gains will be calculated as <span class="tex-text">\((\$75,000 &#8211; \$50,000 &#8211; \$100 &#8211; \$100) = \$24,800\)</span>.Therefore, the net cash flow at Period 1 would be</p>
 <p class="blog">
Period 1:<span class="tex-text">\( 1+ \$75,000 &#8211; \$1002 &#8211; 0.20(\$24,800) = \$69,940\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Then the conditional net present value of this stock transaction is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(PW(5\%) = -\$50,100 + \$69,940(P/F, 5\%, 1) = \$16,510\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This amount of <span class="tex-text">\(\$16,510\)</span> is entered at the tip of the corresponding branch. This procedure is repeated for each possible branch, and the resulting amounts are shown in <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.17(b)\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. With a <span class="tex-text">\(9\%\)</span> return, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 0:<span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; \$50,100\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 1:<span class="tex-text">\(\$53,540\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• <span class="tex-text">\(PW(5\%) = -50,100 + 53,540(P/F, 5\%, 1) = \$890\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
3. With a <span class="tex-text">\(30\%\)</span> loss, we have</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 0: <span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; \$50,100\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 1: <span class="tex-text">\(\$37,940\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• <span class="tex-text">\(PW(5\%) = -\$50,100 + \$37,940(P/F, 5\%, 1) = -\$13,967\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Option 2. Since the interest income on the U.S. government bond will not be taxed, there will be no capital-gains tax. Considering only the brokerage commission, we find that the relevant cash flows would be as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 0: <span class="tex-text">\((- \$50,000 &#8211; \$150) = \$50,150\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Period 1: <span class="tex-text">\((+ \$53,750 &#8211; \$1502 = \$53,600\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• <span class="tex-text">\(PW(5\%) = -\$50,150 + \$53,600(P/F, 5\%, 1) = \$898\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.17(b)\)</span> shows the complete decision tree for Bill’s investment problem. Now Bill can calculate the expected monetary value <span class="tex-text">\((EMV)\)</span> at each chance node. The <span class="tex-text">\(EMV\)</span> of Option 1 represents the sum of the products of the probabilities of high, medium, and low returns and the respective conditional profits (or losses):</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(EMV = \$16,510(0.25) + \$890(0.40) &#8211; \$13,967(0.35) = -\$405\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For Option 2, the <span class="tex-text">\(EMV\)</span> is simply</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(EMV = \$898\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In <span class="tex-text">\(Figure 12.17\)</span>, the expected monetary values are shown in the event nodes. Bill must choose which action to take, and this would be the one with the highest <span class="tex-text">\(EMV\)</span>, namely, Option 2, with <span class="tex-text">\(EMV = \$898\)</span>. This expected value is indicated in<br /> the tree by putting $898 in the decision node at the beginning of the tree. Note that the decision tree uses the idea of maximizing expected monetary value developed in the previous section. In addition, the mark <span class="tex-text">\(\left|\right|\)</span> is drawn across the nonoptimal decision branch (Option 1), indicating that it is not to be followed. In this simple example, the benefit of using a decision tree may not be evident. However, as the decision problem becomes more complex, the decision tree becomes more useful in organizing the information flow needed to make the decision. This is true in particular if Bill must make a sequence of decisions, rather than a single decision, as we next illustrate.</p>
