This is a one-dimensional problem. The first step is to determine the grid. We decided to make node 1 at the ground surface. This is a boundary node with convection. We need another boundary at some depth within the ground. This node, node “n&#8221;, has to be at a depth sufficiently greater than that of the water pipe (More about this later). We decided to make this node an insulated boundary node. The grid is shown in Fig. 5.23.</p>

Let us now develop the energy equations. Like we have done previously, we will assume that all heat flows into a node. And, the heat input during time step <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta t\)</span> is equal to the increase in the internal energy of the node during <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta t\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We have two boundary nodes (nodes 1 and n) and (n-2) interior nodes (nodes 2 through n-1). Let us consider a crosssectional area A for the heat flow. (This area A eventually cancels out of the equations.) The two boundary nodes have a thickness of <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x / 2\)</span>. The interior nodes have a thickness of <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x \)</span>. Therefore, the volume of a boundary node is <span class="tex-text">\((A \Delta x / 2)\)</span>, and the<br /> volume of an interior node is <span class="tex-text">\((A \Delta x )\)</span>.</p>

Water pipes in the northern states of the USA are typically buried at depths of four feet or greater to prevent freezing. We decided to use a nodal increment Δx of 1 inch = 0.0254 m. As we are solving this problem using forward differences, we have to make sure that the chosen time step meets the stability criterion. For our problem, the limiting criterion is that the bracketed expression in Eq. (5.132) may not be negative. That is, for stability,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left(1-\frac{2 \alpha \Delta t}{(\Delta x)^{2}}-\frac{2 h \Delta t}{\rho c(\Delta x)}\right) \geq 0\)</span> (5.135)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Putting in the values of the parameters in Eq. (5.135), it is found that Δt must be equal to or less than 441 s.We decided to make <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta t=5 \min =300 s\)</span>. From the problem statement, we want nodal temperatures after 4 weeks. This is equivalent to <span class="tex-text">\(2.4192 \times 10^{6} s\)</span>. With a time step of 300 s, we need <span class="tex-text">\(2.4192 \times 10^{6} s / 300 s =8064\)</span> time steps.</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
The Matlab program used for the solution is in Appendix K. All nodes were given initial temperatures of 10 C and then we had 8064 successive loops of Equations (5.132) through (5.134). Each loop updated the nodal temperatures for a time step. At the end of the 8064 loops, we had the nodal temperatures after 4 weeks. We then had the program determine the first node at which the temperature was above the freezing point of water, 0 C. The location of that node was the required burial depth.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, as mentioned above, node n has to be sufficiently deeper than the water pipe. We ran the program for several depths, i.e., several different numbers of nodes. We found that if node n was 10 feet or more from the surface, the results of the program did not change. As we had chosen Δx to be 1 inch, 10 feet is equivalent to 120 Δx. Hence, we used 121 nodes in the program.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It was found that the water pipe had to be buried at a depth of at least 4.75 feet to prevent freezing. This result by numerical forward differences is in excellent agreement with the 4.84 feet result of , which was solved using the semiinfinite slab equations.</p>
