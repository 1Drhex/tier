Solution to Part I</p>
 <p class="blog">
The student will have borrowed $80,000.00 by year four and there is no time value of money on the $80,000.00 since no interest is charged on the loan until a student graduates. Therefore, $80,000.00 is the amount owed when the student starts to repay the loan in year five.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Procedure</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, calculate the monthly interest rate and the total numbers of months:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i = \frac{i_n}{m}= \frac{8\% / Year}{12 periods/Year}= 0.667\% per period\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(n = \frac{Number of compounding periods}{Year}\times Number of years\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( = \frac{12 periods}{Year}\times 10 years = 12 periods\)</span> <p class="blog">
Second, calculate the uniform monthly series starting at year five until year 15:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_2 = P\left[\frac{i(1 +i)^n}{(1 +i)^n &#8211; 1} \right]= \$80,000.00\left[\frac{0.00667(1 +0.00667)^{120}}{(1 +0.00667)^{120}-1} \right]\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$80,000.00 \left\lgroup\frac{0.014811}{1.22052} \right\rgroup= \$80,000.00(0.012135)\)</span> <p class="blog">
= $ 970.80 per month</p>
 <p class="blog">
Third, the amount repaid is the monthly payment times the total number of months:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F_{15}\)</span> = $970.80 × 120 months = $116,496.00</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the student paid $36,400.00 in interest on the $80,000.00 repaid monthly over 10 years on the student loan.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fourth, calculate the future worth of the uniform series at year 15:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F_{15}= \$970.80\left[\frac{(1 +0.00667)^{120}- 1}{0.00667} \right]= \$970.80\left\lgroup\frac{1.220522}{0.00667} \right\rgroup\)</span> <p class="blog">
=$ 970.80(182.9869)</p>
 <p class="blog">
= $ 177,643.68</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is the amount the funds would have been worth at year 15 if the monthly payments were invested at an interest rate of 8% per year compounded monthly instead of repaying the student loan.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solution to Part II</p>
 <p class="blog">
The student will have borrowed $80,000.00 by year four and there is no time value of money on the $80,000.00 since no interest is charged on the loan until a student graduates. Therefore, $80,000.00 is the amount owed when the student starts to repay the loan at year five.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Procedure</p>
 <p class="blog">
First, solve for the monthly interest rate and the total numbers of months:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(i = \frac{i_n}{m}= \frac{8\% / Year}{12 periods/Year}= 0.667\% per period\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(n = \frac{Number of compounding periods}{Year}\times Number of years\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( = \frac{12 periods}{Year}\times 20 years = 240 periods\)</span> <p class="blog">
Second, calculate the uniform monthly series starting at year five until year 15:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A = P_0\left[\frac{i(1 +i)^n}{(1 +i)^n &#8211; 1} \right]= \$80,000.00\left[\frac{0.00667(1 +0.00667)^{240}}{(1 +0.00667)^{240}-1} \right]\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(=\$80,000.00 \left\lgroup\frac{0.03289}{3.93072} \right\rgroup= \$80,000.00(0.008367)\)</span> <p class="blog">
= $ 669.40 per month</p>
 <p class="blog">
Third, the amount repaid is the monthly payment times the total number of months:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F_{15}\)</span> = $669.40 × 240 months = $160,656.00</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, the student paid $80,656.00 in interest on the $80,000.00 repaid monthly over 20 years on the student loan.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fourth, calculate the future worth of the uniform series at year 25:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(F_{25}= \$669.40\left[\frac{(1 +0.00667)^{240}- 1}{0.00667} \right]= \$669.40\left\lgroup\frac{3.93072}{0.00667} \right\rgroup\)</span> <p class="blog">
= $ 669.40(589.3133)</p>
 <p class="blog">
= $ 394,486.32</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus is the amount the funds would have been worth at year 25 if the monthly payments were invested at an interest rate of 8% per year compounded monthly instead of repaying the student loan.</p>
