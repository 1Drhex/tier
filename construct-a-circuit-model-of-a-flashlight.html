We chose the flashlight to illustrate a practical system because its components are so familiar. Figure 2.9 shows a photograph of a widely available flashlight. When a flashlight is regarded as an electrical system, the components of primary interest are the batteries, the lamp, the connector, the case, and the switch. We now consider the circuit model for each component. A dry-cell battery maintains a reasonably constant terminal voltage if the current demand is not excessive. Thus if the dry-cell battery is operating within its intended limits, we can model it with an ideal voltage source. The prescribed voltage then is constant and equal to the sum of two dry-cell values. The ultimate output of the lamp is light energy, which is achieved by heating the filament in the lamp to a temperature high enough to cause radiation in the visible range. We can model the lamp with an ideal resistor. Note in this case that although the resistor accounts for the amount of electric energy converted to thermal energy, it does not predict how much of the thermal energy is converted to light energy. The resistor used to represent the lamp does predict the steady current drain on the batteries, a characteristic of the system that also is of interest. In this model,<span class="tex-text">\( R_{l}\)</span>symbolizes the lamp resistance. The connector used in the flashlight serves a dual role. First, it provides an electrical conductive path between the dry cells and the case. Second, it is formed into a springy coil so that it also can apply mechanical pressure to the contact between the batteries and the lamp. The purpose of this mechanical pressure is to maintain contact between the two dry cells and between the dry cells and the lamp. Hence, in choosing the wire for the connector, we may find that its mechanical properties are more important than its electrical properties for the flashlight design. Electrically, we can model the connector with an ideal resistor, labeled <span class="tex-text">\( R_{1}\)</span>.The case also serves both a mechanical and an electrical purpose. Mechanically, it contains all the other components and provides a grip for the person using it. Electrically, it provides a connection between other elements in the flashlight. If the case is metal, it conducts current between the batteries and the lamp. If it is plastic, a metal strip inside the case connects the coiled connector to the switch. Either way, an ideal resistor, which we denote <span class="tex-text">\( R_{c} \)</span>, models the electrical connection provided by the case. The final component is the switch. Electrically, the switch is a two-state device. It is either ON or OFF. An ideal switch offers no resistance to the current when it is in the ON state, but it offers infinite resistance to current when it is in the OFF state. These two states represent the limiting values of a resistor; that is, the ON state corresponds to a resistor with a numerical value of zero, and the OFF state corresponds to a resistor with a numerical value of infinity. The two extreme values have the descriptive names<strong> short circuit </strong><span class="tex-text">\(\left(R=0\right) \)</span>and <strong>open circuit </strong><span class="tex-text">\(\left(R=\infty\right) \)</span>. Figure 2.10(a) and (b) show the graphical representation of a short circuit and an open circuit, respectively. The symbol shown in Fig. 2.10(c) represents the fact that a switch can be either a short circuit or an open circuit, depending on the position of its contacts. We now construct the circuit model of the flashlight. Starting with the dry-cell batteries, the positive terminal of the first cell is connected to the negative terminal of the second cell, as shown in Fig. 2.11. The positive terminal of the second cell is connected to one terminal of the lamp. The other terminal of the lamp makes contact with one side of the switch, and the other side of the switch is connected to the metal case. The metal case is then connected to the negative terminal of the first dry cell by means of the metal spring. Note that the elements form a closed path or circuit. You can see the closed path formed by the connected elements in Fig. 2.11. Figure 2.12 shows a circuit model for the flashlight.</p>
