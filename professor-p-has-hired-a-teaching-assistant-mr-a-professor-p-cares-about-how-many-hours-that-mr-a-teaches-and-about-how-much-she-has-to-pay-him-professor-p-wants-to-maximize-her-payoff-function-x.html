            <p class="blog">Professor P has hired a teaching assistant, Mr A. Professor P cares about how many hours that Mr. A teaches and about how much she has to pay him. Professor P wants to maximize her payoff function, x &#8211; s, where x is the number of hours taught by Mr. A and s is the total wages she pays him. If Mr. A teaches for x hours and is paid s, his utility is s &#8211; c(x) where<br /> c(x) = x²/2. Mr. A&#8217;s reservation utility is zero.</p> <p class="blog">(a) If Professor P chooses x and s to maximize her utility subject to the constraint that Mr. A is willing to work for her, how much teaching will Mr. A be doing?<br /> (b) How much will Professor P have to pay Mr. A to get him to do this amount of teaching?<br /> (c) Suppose that Professor P uses a scheme of the following kind to get Mr. A to work for her. Professor P sets a wage schedule of the form s(x) = ax + b and lets Mr. A choose the number of hours that he wants to work. What values of a and b should Professor P choose so as to maximize her payoff function? Could Professor P achieve a higher payoff if she were able to use a wage schedule of more general functional form?</p>

<strong>a.</strong> The professor must pay s = x²/2 to get the assistant to work x hours. Her payoff will be x − x²/2. This is maximized where x = 1.<br /> <strong>b.</strong> The TA must get his reservation utility when he chooses the optimal x. This means that s − x²/2 = s−1/2 = 0, so s = 1/2.<br /> <strong>c.</strong> The best the professor can do is to get Mr. A to work 1 hour and have a utility of zero. Mr. A will work up to the point where he maximizes<br /> ax + b − x²/2. Using calculus, we find that Mr. A will choose x = a.<br /> Therefore he will work one hour if a = 1. Then his utility will be 0 if b = −1.</p>
