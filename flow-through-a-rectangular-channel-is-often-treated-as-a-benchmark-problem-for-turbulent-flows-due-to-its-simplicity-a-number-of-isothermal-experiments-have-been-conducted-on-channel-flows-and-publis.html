            <p class="blog">Flow through a rectangular channel is often treated as a benchmark problem for turbulent flows due to its simplicity. A number of isothermal experiments have been conducted on channel flows and published by Laufer (1951). These experimental data may be used to check the turbulent flow models. We have considered here a simple, moderate Reynolds number flow problem through a rectangular channel. The channel is assumed to be 2 units wide and 40 units long. The Reynolds number is defined based on the half width of the channel. Several structured meshes were tried and the results presented here are generated on a nonuniform structured mesh with 6400 nodes and 12446 elements. The first node from the wall is placed at a nondimensional distance of 0.005 . The results may be further improved by increasing the resolution of the mesh.</p>

A nondimensional horizontal velocity component of unity and vertical velocity component of zero are assumed at the inlet. No slip conditions are applied on both walls of the channel. For the one equation <span class="tex-text">\( \kappa-l\)</span> turbulence model, a fixed value of nondimensional <span class="tex-text">\( \kappa=0.05\)</span> is assumed at the inlet. On the walls, zero value is assumed for the turbulent kinetic energy. For the SA model, the nondimensional scalar variable <span class="tex-text">\( \hat{v}\)</span> is prescribed equal to 0.05 at the inlet and zero on the walls. The boundary conditions for the two equation turbulence models are: inlet values of both <span class="tex-text">\( \kappa\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \varepsilon\)</span> are prescribed <span class="tex-text">\( \kappa=0.05\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \varepsilon=0.05\)</span> based on the idea proposed in Johansson et al., (1993). On the walls, <span class="tex-text">\( \kappa=0\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \varepsilon=(2 / \operatorname{Re})\left(d \kappa^{1 / 2} / d y\right)^{2}\)</span> are prescribed as proposed in Yang and Shih (1993) . Figure 8.2 shows the comparison of fully developed velocity profiles obtained from all the three turbulence models with the experimental data of Laufer (1951). A rapid convergence to steady state was obtained using both one-equation and SA models. However, the two equation model has difficulties in to converging and took a longer time. All the methods seem to give solutions close to the experimental data. It may be possible to further improve the solution by fine tuning the boundary conditions of the turbulence variables and damping functions.Often, engineering problems are quite complex and thus domain discretization is easy to carry out if unstructured meshes are used. However, unstructured meshes in general are less accurate than structured meshes. In order to estimate the accuracy of using an unstructured mesh, we carried out a comparison between structured and unstructured mesh results of flow through a rectangular channel. In general, agreement with the experimental average velocity profile is close if the unstructured element size is comparable to the element size of a structured mesh near the solid walls (Nithiarasu et al., 2007). In order to further estimate the accuracy in terms of friction velocity or shear velocity, a comparison between the structured and unstructured mesh results for flow through a rectangular channel is shown in Figure 8.3.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\text { The friction velocity is defined in dimensional form as }\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(u_{\tau}=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{w}}{\rho}}\)</span> (8.60)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{w}\)</span> is the local wall shear stress and <span class="tex-text">\( \rho\)</span> is the density. In nondimensional form, this may be written as</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(u_{\tau}^{*}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\operatorname{Re}} \frac{\partial \bar{u}_{t}^{*}}{\partial n^{*}}}\)</span> (8.61)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where the superscript * indicates a nondimensional quantity, subscript t indicates the tangential direction and n is the normal direction. For more details on the calculation of wall shear stress, readers are referred to Chapter 7 . The friction velocity is often normalized against the average velocity as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(u^{+}=\frac{u_{\tau}}{\bar{u}}\)</span> (8.62)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where both <span class="tex-text">\( u_{\tau}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \bar{u}\)</span> can be used either in a dimensional or nondimensional form to obtain the above ratio, as long as the same scales are employed in nondimensionalising the velocities. Equation (8.62) may be plotted against a nondimensional normal distance from the wall. The non-dimensional distance is generally calculated as</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(y^{+}=\frac{y u_{\tau}}{v}\)</span> (8.63)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\text { or, in nondimensional form }\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(y^{+}=R e y^{*} u_{\tau}^{*}\)</span> (8.64)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 8.3 shows the variation of <span class="tex-text">\( u^{+}\)</span> against the logarithmic nondimensional distance <span class="tex-text">\( y^{+} . \)</span> This figure shows the experimental data, structured and unstructured mesh results for the channel flow problem. As seen, only the SA model is used in the flow calculations. The first node of the structured mesh was placed at a distance of 0.005 and the unstructured mesh was placed roughly around 0.01. As seen, the logarithmic representation of the time averaged velocity variation is close to the experimental data of Laufer (1951). The differences between the structured and unstructured meshes are attributed to the larger element size of the unstructured mesh used close to the wall.</p>
