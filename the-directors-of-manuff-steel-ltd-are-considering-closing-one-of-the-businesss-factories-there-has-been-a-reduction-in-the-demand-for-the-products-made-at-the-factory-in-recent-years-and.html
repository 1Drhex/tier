            <p class="blog">The directors of Manuff (Steel) Ltd are considering closing one of the business’s factories. There has been a reduction in the demand for the products made at the factory in recent years, and the directors are not optimistic about the long-term prospects for these products. The factory is situated in the north of England, in an area where unemployment is high. The factory is leased, and there are still four years of the lease remaining. The directors are uncertain as to whether the factory should be closed immediately or at the end of the period of the lease. Another business has offered to sublease the premises from Manuff at a rental of £40,000 a year for the remainder of the lease period. The machinery and equipment at the factory cost £1,500,000, and have a balance sheet value of £400,000. In the event of immediate closure, the machinery and equipment could be sold for £220,000. The working capital at the factory is £420,000, and could be liquidated for that amount immediately, if required. Alternatively, the working capital can be liquidated in full at the end of the lease period. Immediate closure would result in redundancy payments to employees of £180,000. If the factory continues in operation until the end of the lease period, the following operating profits (losses) are expected:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table > <tbody> <tr> <td width="170"></td> <td width="142"><em>Year 1</em></td> <td width="130"><em>Year 2</em></td> <td width="142"><em>Year 3</em></td> <td width="127"><em>Year 4</em></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="170"></td> <td width="142"><em>£000</em></td> <td width="130"><em>£000</em></td> <td width="142"><em>£000</em></td> <td width="127"><em>£000</em></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="170">Operating profit (loss)</td> <td width="142"><em>160</em></td> <td width="130">(40)</td> <td width="142">30</td> <td width="127">20</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Notes:<br /> 1 Each year’s operating cash flows are calculated by adding back the depreciation charge for the year to the operating profit for the year. In the case of the operating loss, the depreciation charge is deducted.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2 In the event of closure, machinery could be sold immediately. Thus an opportunity cost of £220,000 is incurred if operations continue.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 By continuing operations, there will be a saving in immediate redundancy costs of £180,000. However, redundancy costs of £150,000 will be paid in four years’ time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 By continuing operations, the opportunity to sublease the factory will be foregone.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5 Immediate closure would mean that working capital could be liquidated. By continuing operations this opportunity is foregone. However, working capital can be liquidated in four years’ time.</p>

(c) Other factors that may influence the decision include:</p>
 <ul> <li> The overall strategy of the business. The business may need to set the decision within a broader context. It may be necessary to manufacture the products made at the factory because they are an integral part of the business’s product range. The business may wish to avoid redundancies in an area of high unemployment for as long as possible.</li> <li>Flexibility. A decision to close the factory is probably irreversible. If the factory continues, however, there may be a chance that the prospects for the factory will brighten in the future.</li> <li>Creditworthiness of sublessee. The business should investigate the creditworthiness of the sublessee. Failure to receive the expected sublease payments would make the closure option far less attractive.</li> <li> Accuracy of forecasts. The forecasts made by the business should be examined carefully. Inaccuracies in the forecasts or any underlying assumptions may change the expected outcomes.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
(d) The NPV of the decision to continue operations rather than close immediately is positive. Hence, shareholders would be better off if the directors took this course of action. The factory should therefore continue in operation rather than close down. This decision is likely to be welcomed by employees and would allow the business to maintain its flexibility.</p>
