In order to keep inventories (stock) of finished suitcases to a minimum, each model is made in a small batch. Each batch is costed as a separate job and the cost for each suitcase deduced by dividing the batch cost by the number of suitcases in the batch.<br /> At present, the business derives the cost of each batch using a traditional job-costing approach. Recently, however, a new management accountant was appointed, who is advocating the use of activity-based costing (ABC) to deduce the cost of the batches. The management accountant claims that ABC leads to much more reliable and relevant costs and that it has other benefits.<br /> <strong>Required</strong>:<br /> (a) Explain how the business deduces the cost of each suitcase at present.<br /> (b) Discuss the purposes to which the knowledge of the cost for each suitcase, deduced on a traditional basis, can be put and how valid the cost is for the purpose concerned.</p> <p class="blog">(c) Explain how ABC could be applied to costing the suitcases, highlighting the differences between ABC and the traditional approach.<br /> (d) Explain what advantages the new management accountant probably believes ABC to have over the traditional approach.</p>

<strong>Kaplan plc</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) At present, the business makes each model of suitcase in a batch. The direct materials and labour costs will be recorded in respect of each batch. To these costs will be added a share of the overheads of the business for the period in which production of the batch takes place. The basis of the batch absorbing overheads is a matter of managerial judgement.<br /> Direct labour hours spent working on the batch, relative to total direct labour hours worked during the period, is a popular method. This is not the ‘correct’ way, however.<br /> There is no correct way. If the activity is capital intensive, some machine-hour basis of dealing with overheads might be more appropriate, though still not ‘correct’.<br /> Overheads might be collected, department by department, and charged to the batch as it passes through each department. Alternatively, all of the overheads for the entire production facility might be totalled and the overheads dealt with more globally. It is only in restricted circumstances that overheads charged to batches will be affected by a decision to deal with them departmentally, rather than globally.<br /> Once the ‘full cost’ (direct costs plus a share of indirect costs) has been ascertained for the batch, the cost per suitcase can be established by dividing the batch cost by the number in the batch.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The uses to which full cost information can be put have been identified as:</p>
 <ul> <li>For pricing purposes. In some industries and circumstances, full costs are used as the basis of pricing. Here the full cost is deduced and a percentage is added on for profit. This is known as cost-plus pricing. A solicitor handling a case for a client probably provides an example of this.</li> <li>In many circumstances, however, suppliers are not in a position to deduce prices on a cost-plus basis. Where there is a competitive market, a supplier will probably need to accept the price that the market offers – that is, most suppliers are ‘price takers’ not ‘price makers’.</li> <li>For income-measurement purposes. To provide a valid means of measuring a business’s income, it is necessary to match expenses with the revenue realised in the same accounting period. Where manufactured products is made or partially made in one period but sold in the next, or where a service is partially rendered in one accounting period but the revenue is realised in the next, the full cost (including an appropriate share of overheads) must be carried from one accounting period to the next. Unless we are able to identify the full cost of work done in one period, which is the subject of a sale in the next, the profit figures of the periods concerned will become meaningless. Unless all related production costs are charged in the same accounting period as the sale is recognised in the income statement, distortions will occur that will render the income statement much less useful. Thus it is necessary to deduce the full cost of any production undertaken completely or partially in one accounting period but sold in a subsequent one.</li> <li> For budgetary planning and control. Often budgets are set in terms of full costs. If budgets are to be used as the yardsticks that actual performance is to be assessed, the information on actual performance must also be expressed in the same full-cost terms. Knowing the full cost of the suitcases could be helpful in these activities.</li> <li>General decision making. Knowing the full-cost of the suitcases might be helpful in making a decision as to whether to continue to make all or some of the models. It is argued, however, that relevant costs, which might be just the variable costs, would provide a more helpful basis for the decision.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
(c) Whereas the traditional approach to dealing with overheads is just to accept that they exist and deal with them in a fairly broad manner, ABC takes a much more enquiring approach. ABC takes the view that overheads do not just ‘occur’, but that they are caused or ‘driven’ by ‘activities’. It is a matter of finding out which activities are driving the costs and how much cost they are driving. For example, a significant part of the costs of making suitcases of different sizes might be resetting machinery to cope with a batch of a different size from its predecessor batch. Where a particular model is made in very small batches, because it has only a small market, ABC would advocate that this model is charged directly with its machine-setting costs. The traditional approach would be to treat machine setting as a general overhead that the individual suitcases (irrespective of the model) might bear equally. ABC, it is claimed, leads to more accurate costing and thus to more accurate assessment of profitability.<br /> (d) The other advantage of pursuing an ABC philosophy and identifying cost drivers is that, once the drivers have been identified, they are likely to become much more susceptible to being controlled. Thus the ability of management to assess the benefit of certain activities against their cost becomes more feasible.</p>
