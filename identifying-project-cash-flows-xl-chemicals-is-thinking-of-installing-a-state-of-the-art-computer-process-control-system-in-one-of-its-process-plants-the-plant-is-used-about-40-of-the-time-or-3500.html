            <p class="blog"><strong>Identifying Project Cash Flows</strong></p> <p class="blog">XL Chemicals is thinking of installing a state-of-the-art computer process-control system in one of its process plants. The plant is used about 40% of the time (or 3,500 operating hours per year) to produce a proprietary demulsification chemical. During the remaining 60% of the time, it is used to produce other specialty chemicals. Annual production of the demulsification chemical amounts to 30,000 kilograms, and it sells for $15 per kilogram. The proposed computer process-control system will cost $650,000 and is expected to provide the following specific benefits in the production of the demulsification chemical.</p> <p class="blog">• First, the selling price of the product could be increased by $2 per kilogram because the product will be of higher purity, which translates into better demulsification.</p> <p class="blog">• Second, production volumes will increase by 4,000 kilograms per year as a result of higher reaction yields, without any increase in the quantities of raw material or in production time.</p> <p class="blog">• Third, the number of process operators can be reduced by one per shift, which represents a savings of $25 per hour.</p> <p class="blog">The new control system would result in additional maintenance costs of $53,000 per year and has an expected useful life of eight years. It is also expected to have a salvage value of $50,000 at the end of its useful life. Although the system is likely to provide similar benefits in the production of the other specialty chemicals manufactured in the process plant, these benefits have not yet been quantified. What is the net cash flow in each year?</p>

Although we could assume that similar benefits are derivable from the production of the other specialty chemicals, let’s restrict our consideration to the demulsification chemical and allocate the full initial cost of the control system and the annual maintenance costs to this chemical. (Note that you could logically argue that only 40% of these costs belong to this production activity.) The gross benefits are the additional revenues realized from the increased selling price and the extra production, as well as the cost savings resulting from having one fewer operator.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Revenues from the price increases are 30,000 kilograms per year <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> $2/kilogram, or $60,000 per year. The added production volume at the new pricing adds revenues of 4,000 kilograms per year <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> $17 per kilogram, or $68,000 per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The elimination of one operator results in an annual savings of 3,500 operating hours per year <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> $25 per hour, or $87,500 per year.<br /> • The net benefits in each of the eight years that make up the useful lifetime of the new system are the gross benefits less the maintenance costs:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">($60,000 + $68,000 + $87,500 &#8211; $53,000) = $162,500 per year</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The cash flow in eight years will be adjusted by the amount of salvage of $50,000. Now we are ready to summarize a cash flow table.</p>

<strong>Comments:</strong> If the company purchases the computer process-control system for $650,000 now, it can expect an annual savings of $162,500 for eight years. (Note that these savings are represented in discrete lump sums at the end of each year.) We also considered only the benefits associated with the production of the demulsification chemical. We could have quantified some benefits attributable to the production of the other chemicals from this plant. Suppose that the demulsification chemical benefits alone justify the acquisition of the new system. Then it is obvious that, had we considered the benefits associated with the other chemicals as well, the acquisition of the system would have been even more clearly justified.<br /> We draw a cash flow diagram of this situation in Figure 5.2. Assuming that these cost savings and cash flow estimates are correct, should management give the go-ahead for installation of the system? If management decides not to purchase the computer process-control system, what should it do with the $650,000 (assuming that it has this amount in the first place)? The company could buy $650,000 of Treasury bonds, or it could invest the amount in other cost-saving projects. How would the company compare cash flows that differ both in timing and amount for the alternatives it is considering? This is an extremely important question, because virtually every engineering investment decision involves a comparison of alternatives. Indeed, these are the types of questions this chapter is designed to help you answer.</p>
