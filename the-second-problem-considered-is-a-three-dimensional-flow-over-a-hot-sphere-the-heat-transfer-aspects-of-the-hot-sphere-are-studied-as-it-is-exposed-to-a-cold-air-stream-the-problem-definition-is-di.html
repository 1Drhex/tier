In the problem discussed here, an outer boundary is fixed in such a way that the inlet is at a distance of five diameters from the center of the sphere and the exit is at 20 diameters from downstream of the center of the sphere (Nithiarasu et.al. 2004). The side boundaries are also at a distance of 5 diameters away from the center of the sphere. It is possible to imagine the sphere being placed inside a three-dimensional channel, which is 25 diameters in length and has 10 diameter long sides. However, the difference from the previous channel problem is that there is no solid outer wall in this case.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The boundary conditions are simple as in the previous problem. The inlet has a nondimensional velocity of unity and a nondimensional temperature of zero. The surface of the sphere is subjected to a no-slip velocity boundary condition and a nondimensional temperature of unity. All the side walls are subjected to a zero heat flux and a zero normal velocity value. At the exit the insulated conditions are assumed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is obvious that a three-dimensional mesh is required and for the problem under consideration linear tetrahedral elements were used. Three dimensional meshes were generated using an efficient mesh generator as reported by Morgan et al. 1999. The total number of elements used in the computation was approximately a million. The sphere and a cross-sectional side view along the axis are shown in Figure 7.38</p>
 <p class="blog">
The temperature contours in the vicinity of the sphere are shown in Figure 7.39 for inlet Reynolds numbers of 100 and 200. As mentioned previously, the temperature on the surface of the sphere is unity. This diagram shows a cut view along the axis in the direction of the flow. Therefore, the temperature values close to the surface of the sphere are near to unity, which<br /> reduce in value away from the sphere and finally reach zero value (except in the wake), in the free air stream. In the downstream direction, however, the temperatures are greater than that of the free stream temperature all the way to the exit (see Figure 7.40). This indicates that the cold air stream removes heat from the sphere, which is then transported to the exit.</p>
