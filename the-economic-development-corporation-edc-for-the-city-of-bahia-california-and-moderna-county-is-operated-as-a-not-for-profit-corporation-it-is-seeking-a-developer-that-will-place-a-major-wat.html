            <p class="blog">The Economic Development Corporation (EDC) for the city of Bahia, California and Modern a County is operated as a not-for-profit corporation. It is seeking a developer that will place a major water park in the city or county area. Financial incentives will be awarded. In response to a request for proposal (RFP) to the major water park developers in the country, four proposals have been received. Larger and more intricate water rides and increased size of the park will attract more customers, thus different levels of initial incentives are requested in the proposals.<br /> Approved and in-place economic incentive guidelines allow entertainment industry prospects to receive up to $1 million cash as a first-year incentive award and 10% of this amount each year for 8 years in property tax reduction. Each proposal includes a provision that residents of the city or county will benefit from reduced entrance (usage) fees when using the park. This fee reduction will be in effect as long as the property tax reduction incentive continues. The EDC has estimated the annual total entrance fees with the reduction included for local residents. Also, EDC estimated the benefits of extra sales tax revenue. These estimates and the costs for the initial incentive and annual 10% tax reduction are summarized in the top section of Table 7.1.</p> <p class="blog">TABLE 7.1 Estimates of Costs and Benefts, and the Incremental B/C Analysis for Four Water Park Proposals, Example 7.4</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 1119px;" width="772"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="64"></td> <td width="64"> Proposal 1</td> <td width="64"> Proposal 2</td> <td width="64"> Proposal 3</td> <td width="64"> Proposal 4</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Initial incentive, $</td> <td>250,000</td> <td>350,000</td> <td>500,000</td> <td>800,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Tax incentive cost, $/year</td> <td>25,000</td> <td>35,000</td> <td>50,000</td> <td>80,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Resident entrance fees, $/yea</td> <td>500,000</td> <td>450,000</td> <td>425,000</td> <td>250,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Extra sales taxes, $/year</td> <td>310,000</td> <td>320,000</td> <td>320,000</td> <td>340,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Study period, year</td> <td>8</td> <td>8</td> <td>8</td> <td>8</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5" width="320">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">AW of total costs, $/yea</td> <td>66,867</td> <td>93,614</td> <td>133,735</td> <td>213,976</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Alternatives compared</td> <td></td> <td>2-to-1</td> <td>3-to-2</td> <td>4-to-2</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5" width="320">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Incremental costs C, $/year</td> <td></td> <td>26,747</td> <td>40,120</td> <td>120,360</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Entrance fee reduction, $/year</td> <td></td> <td>50,000</td> <td>25,000</td> <td>200,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Extra sales tax, $/year</td> <td></td> <td>10,000</td> <td>0</td> <td>20,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Incremental benefts <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B\)</span>, $/year</td> <td></td> <td>60,000</td> <td>25,000</td> <td>220,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Incremental B/C ratio</td> <td></td> <td>2.24</td> <td>0.62</td> <td>1.83</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Increment justifed?</td> <td></td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64">Alternative selected</td> <td></td> <td>2</td> <td>2</td> <td>4</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

The viewpoint taken for the economic analysis is that of a resident of the city or county. The first-year cash incentives and annual tax reduction incentives are real costs to the residents. Benefits are derived from two components: the decreased entrance fee estimates and the increased sales tax receipts. These will benefit each citizen indirectly through the increase in money available to those who use the park and through the city and county budgets where sales tax receipts are deposited. Since these benefits must be calculated indirectly from<br /> these two components, the alternatives are classified as usage cost estimates.<br /> Table 7.1 includes the results of applying an AW-based incremental B/C procedure.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. For each alternative, the capital recovery amount over 8 years is determined and added to the annual property tax incentive cost. For proposal #1</p>
 <p class="blog">
AW of total costs =initial incentive (A /P,7%,8)+ tax cost</p>
 <p class="blog">
=$250,000 (A/ P,7%,8) +25,000= $66,867</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. The usage-cost alternatives are ordered by the AW of total costs in Table 7.1.<br /> 3. Table 7.1 shows incremental costs. For the 2-to-1 comparison</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Delta C\)</span>= $93,614 -66,867= $26,747</p>
 <p class="blog">
Incremental benefits for an alternative are the sum of the resident entrance fees compared to those of the next-lower-cost alternative, plus the increase in sales tax receipts over those of the next-lower-cost alternative. Thus, the benefits are determined incrementally for each pair of alternatives. For the 2-to-1 comparison, resident entrance fees decrease by $50,000 per year and the sales tax receipts increase by $10,000. The total benefit is the sum,<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B\)</span> $60,000 per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. For the 2-to-1 comparison, Equation [7.5] results in<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B/C\)</span> =$60,000 /$26,747 =2.24</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. Alternative #2 is clearly justified. Alternative #1 is eliminated.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. This process is repeated for the 3-to-2 comparison, which has <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B/C\)</span>&lt; 1.0<br /> because the incremental benefits are substantially less than the increase in costs. Proposal #3 is eliminated, and the 4-to-2 comparison results in</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B\)</span>=200,000+ 20,000 $220,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Delta C\)</span>= 213,976 &#8211; 93,614= $120,362</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B/C\)</span>=220,000/ $120,362 =1.83</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta B/C\)</span>&gt; 1.0, proposal #4 survives as the one remaining alternative</p>
