We start at the beginning of the project and work our way to the end of the project, calculating the ben-efit to the owner at the end of each month and just before payment is made to the construction company.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the owner does not make a payment during the first month, the first point in time we calculate the ben-efit is at the end of the first month. From  the monthly bill to the owner is $129,600 and the monthly benefit is calculated using Eq. (4) as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{n} =Cash_{n-1} + Bills_{n} &#8211; Receipt_{n}\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{n}\)</span>= $0 + $129,600 &#8211; $0 = $129,600</p>
 <p class="blog">
At the end of the first month the construction company and its suppliers and subcontractors have provided the proj-ect’s owner with $129,600 in funding for the project.<br /> The next point in time we need to calculate the benefit to the owner is just before receipt of the first payment from the owner, which occurs at the end of the second month. The benefit just before the payment has been received is equal to the cash from the previous month plus the cost of the work completed between the end of the previous month and just before receipt of payment from the owner. The cost of the work completed between the end of the previous month and just before receipt of payment from the owner is approximately equal to the billing to the owner. The benefit is calculated using Eq. (4) as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{1 َ}\)</span> = $129,600 + $248,400 &#8211; 0 = $378,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
The benefit for the end of the second month is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{2 }\)</span>= $129,600 + $248,400 &#8211; $116,640 = $261,360</p>
 <p class="blog">
The benefits for the third through seventh months are cal-culated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{3 َ}\)</span>= $261,360 + $313,200 &#8211; $0 = $574,560</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{3 }\)</span>= $261,360 + $313,200 &#8211; $223,560 = $351,000</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{4 }\)</span>= $351,000 + $183,600 &#8211; $281,880 = $252,720</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Cash_{7 }\)</span>= $176,040 + $0 &#8211; $176,040 = $0</p>
 <p class="blog">
As expected, when the owner has paid for the project in full, the benefit provided by the construction company and its suppliers and subcontractors is zero. The maximum benefit provided by the construction company and its sup-pliers and subcontractors occurs during the third month and has a value in excess of half of the total cost of the project to the owner. In other words, during the third month the construction company and its suppliers and subcon-tractors are providing over half of the funds needed to con-struct the project.</p>
