            <p class="blog">New Product Decisions with Risk Aversion<br /> This example is the same as Acme’s single-stage decision problem in , but we now assume that Acme is risk averse and that it assesses its utility function as exponential with risk tolerance $5 million. How does this risk aversion affect its decision making progress?<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To see how risk aversion affects Acme’s decision-making process.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The only new number is the risk tolerance. According to the earlier discussion, this value implies that Acme is indifferent between entering a gamble where it could win $5 million or lose $2.5 million on the flip of a fair coin, or not enter the gamble at all. This risk tolerance is a difficult number to assess, so it is a good candidate for a sensitivity analysis.</p>

Starting with the decision tree from the previous example (see Figure 9.11), there are only two changes to make. First, it is useful to add the risk tolerance as a new input, as shown in cell B12 of Figure 9.27. Second, you must tell PrecisionTree that you want to use expected utility. To do so, select Model Settings from the PrecisionTree Settings dropdown list, select the Utility Function tab, and fill it in as shown in Figure 9.28. The most important part is to check the “Use Utility Function” option. Then you can choose any of three display options. If you choose Expected Value, you will see EMVs on the tree (in the colored cells), but expected utility will actually be maximized in the background. This is useful if you want to see how much EMV you are sacrificing by being risk-averse. Alternatively, if you choose Expected Utility, as is done here, you will see utility values rather than monetary values. The Certainty Equivalent option will be discussed shortly. The resulting tree that displays expected utilities appears in Figure 9.29. If you compare this tree to the EMV tree in Figure 9.11, you will see that Acme’s best strategy has been reversed. As an EMV maximizer, Acme should market the product. As a risk-averse expected utility maximizer, it should not market the product. The expected utility from marketing the product is negative, −0.0472 in cell C15, and the utility from not marketing the product is 0. (We formatted these as decimal numbers in the tree. They are not expressed in dollars.) Neither of these expected utilities is meaningful in an absolute sense; only their relative values are important. The larger corresponds to the best decision.</p>

<strong>PrecisionTree Tip</strong>: Calculations with utilities<br /> The PrecisionTree utility calculations are not as mysterious as they might seem. PrecisionTree takes the (blue) monetary values that originally follow the end nodes and transforms them to utility values by using Equation (9.6). Then it folds back in the usual way, except that it uses utility values, not monetary values, in the folding-back calculations.</p>

 <p class="blog">
<strong>Certainty Equivalents</strong><br /> The reversal in Acme’s decision can be understood better by looking at certainty equivalents. For a risk-averse person, the certainty equivalent of a gamble is the sure dollar amount the person would accept to avoid the gamble. In other words, the person is indifferent between taking this sure amount and taking the gamble. By selecting Certainty Equivalent in Figure 9.28, you can see the certainty equivalents in the tree, as shown in Figure 9.30. (We formatted the certainty equivalents as currencies because that’s what they really are.) Recall from Figure 9.11 that the EMV for marketing the product is $1.074 million. However, this is not how the risk-averse Acme sees the decision to market the product. Acme now sees this gamble as equivalent to a loss of approximately $230,000. In other words, Acme would pay up to $230,000 to avoid this gamble. Of course, it doesn’t have to pay anything. The company can simply decide to abandon the product and receive a sure payoff of $0; hence, the TRUE on the bottom branch. gain, risk aversion is all about giving up some EMV to avoid a gamble. In this case, Acme is able to obtain an EMV of $1.074 million by marketing the product, but the company is willing to trade this for a sure $0 payoff because of its aversion to risk. What happens if Acme is less risk-averse, with a larger risk tolerance? You can check, for example, that if the company’s risk tolerance doubles from $5 million to $10 million, the best decision reverts back to the original “market the product” decision, and the certainty equivalent of this decision increases to about $408,000. In this case, the company views the gamble, with an EMV of $1.074 million, as equivalent to a sure $408,000 payoff. Only when the company’s risk tolerance becomes huge will the certainty equivalent be near the original EMV of $1.074 million.</p>
