            <p class="blog">Brackets, such as the one shown, are used in mooring small watercraft. Failure of such brackets is usually caused by bearing pressure of the mooring clip against the side of the hole. Our purpose here is to get an idea of the static and dynamic margins of safety involved. We use a bracket 1/4 in thick made of hot-rolled 1018 steel. We then assume wave action on the boat will create force F no greater than 1200 lbf.<br /> (a) Identify the moment M that produces a shear stress on the throat resisting bending action with a “tension” at A and “compression” at C.<br /> (b) Find the force component <span class="tex-text">\(F_{y}\)</span> that produces a shear stress at the throat resisting a “tension” throughout the weld.<br /> (c) Find the force component <span class="tex-text">\(F_{x}\)</span> that produces an in-line shear throughout the weld.<br /> (d) Find <span class="tex-text">\(A, I_{u} \text {, and } I\)</span> using Table 9–2, in part.<br /> (e) Find the shear stress <span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{1}\)</span> at A due to <span class="tex-text">\(F_{y}\)</span> and M, the shear stress <span class="tex-text">\(\tau_{2}\)</span> due to <span class="tex-text">\(F_{x}\)</span> , and combine to find τ .<br /> (f) Find the factor of safety guarding against shear yielding in the weldment.<br /> (g) Find the factor of safety guarding against a static failure in the parent metal at the weld.<br /> (h) Find the factor of safety guarding against a fatigue failure in the weld metal using a Gerber failure criterion.</p> <p class="blog"><picture><source srcset="https://vlavar.com/imagesdb/uploads/2021/11/9.52.png.webp 564w, https://vlavar.com/imagesdb/uploads/2021/11/9.52-293x300.png.webp 293w, https://vlavar.com/imagesdb/uploads/2021/11/9.52-147x150.png.webp 147w" sizes='(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px' type='image/webp'><img class="aligncenter wp-image-458136 size-full" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/11/9.52.png" alt="Brackets, such as the one shown, are used in mooring small watercraft.
