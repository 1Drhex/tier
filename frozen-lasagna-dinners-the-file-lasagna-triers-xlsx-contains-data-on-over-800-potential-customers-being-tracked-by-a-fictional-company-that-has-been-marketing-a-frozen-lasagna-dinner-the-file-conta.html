The file contains a number of demographics on these customers, as indicated in Figure 3.52: their age, weight, income, pay type, car value, credit card debt, gender, whether they live alone, dwelling type, monthly number of trips to the mall, and neighborhood. It also indicates whether they have tried the company’s frozen lasagna. The company wants to understand why some potential customers are triers and others are not. Does gender make a difference? Does income make a difference? In general, what distinguishes triers from nontriers?

The key is to set up a pivot table that shows counts of triers and nontriers for different categories of any of the potential explanatory variables. For example, one such pivot table shows the percentages of triers and nontriers for males and females separately. If the percentages are different for males than for females, the company will know that gender has an effect. On the other hand, if the percentages for males and females are about the same, the company will know that gender does not make much of a difference.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The typical pivot table should be set up as shown in Figure 3.53. The Rows variable is any demographic variable you want to investigate—in this case, Gender. The Columns variable is Have Tried (Yes or No). The Values variable can be any variable, as long as it is expressed as a count. Finally, it is useful to show these counts as percentage of row totals. This way you can easily look down column C to see whether the percentage in one category (Female) who have tried the product is any different from the percentage in another category (Male) who have tried the product. As you can see, males are somewhat more likely to try the product than females: 60.92% versus 54.27%. This is also apparent from the associated pivot chart.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once this generic pivot table and associated pivot chart are set up, you can easily explore other demographic variables by swapping them for Gender. For example, Figure 3.54 indicates that people who live alone are (not surprisingly) much more likely to try this frozen microwave product than people who don’t live alone.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As another example, Figure 3.55 indicates that people with larger incomes are slightly more likely to try the product. There are two things to note about this income pivot table. First, because there are so many individual income values, grouping is useful. You can experiment with the grouping to get the most meaningful results. Second, you should be a bit skeptical about the last group, which has 100% triers. It is possible that there are only one or two people in this group. (It turns out that there are four.) For this reason, it is a good idea to create two pivot tables of the counts, one showing percentage of row totals and one showing the raw counts. This second pivot table is shown at the bottom of Figure 3.55.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The problem posed in this example is a common one in real business situations. One variable indicates whether people are in one group or another (triers or nontriers), and there are a lot of other variables that could potentially explain why some people are in one group and others are in the other group. There are a number of sophisticated techniques for attacking this classification problem, and some of these are discussed in Chapter 17. However, you can go a long way toward understanding which variables are important by the simple pivot table method illustrated here.</p>
