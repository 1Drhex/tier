            <p class="blog">PURCHASING TELEVISION ADS</p> <p class="blog">The General Flakes Company sells a brand of low-fat breakfast cereal that appeals to people of all age groups and both genders. The company advertises this cereal in a variety of 30-second television ads, and these ads can be placed in a variety of television shows. The ads in different shows vary by cost—some 30-second slots are much more expensive than others—and by the types of viewers they are likely to reach. The company has segmented the potential viewers into six mutually exclusive categories: males age 18 to 35; males age 36 to 55; males over 55; females age 18 to 35; females age 36 to 55; and females over 55. A rating service can supply data on the numbers of viewers in each of these categories who will watch a 30-second ad on any particular television show. Each such viewer is called an exposure. The company has determined the required number of exposures it wants to obtain for each group. It wants to know how many ads to place on each of several television shows to obtain these required exposures at minimum cost. The data on costs per ad, numbers of exposures per ad, and minimal required exposures are listed in Table 4.1, where numbers of exposures are expressed in millions, and costs are in thousands of dollars.

This problem is straightforward to model. As indicated in Figure 4.1 (see the file Advertising 1 Big Picture.xlsx), the company needs to decide how many ads to place on each television show. This determines the total advertising cost, which becomes the objective to minimize, and the total number of exposures to each viewer group. The only constraint, other than nonnegativity, is that there must be at least the required number of exposures for each group.</p>

<strong>Comparison to Product Mix Model</strong><br /> Before continuing, note that this model is essentially the opposite of the product mix models in the previous chapter. With a product mix model, the goal is to make the values of the decision variables (numbers of items to produce) as large as possible to make a large profit. The constraints on resource availability impose a limit on these values. In contrast, the goal now is to make the values of the decision variables as small as possible to minimize cost. This time, the constraints on required exposures impose lower limits on these values. These two prototype LP models—maximizing profit subject to “less than or equal to” constraints, and minimizing cost subject to “greater than or equal to” constraints—are certainly not the only types of LP models that exist, but they are very common.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed model for the advertising problem appears in Figure 4.2<span class="tex-text">\(.^{2}\)</span> (See the file Advertising 1 Finished.xlsx.) The model can be created with the following steps:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<div class="image-clearfix"> <img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/4.2-300x179.jpg"></div></p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Input values and range names. Enter the inputs from Table 4.1 in light blue ranges, and name the ranges as shown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Range Name Shortcut We’ve said it before, but we’ll say it again. Whenever possible, use short and descriptive labels such as in cells A19 and B22. Then you can take advantage of these labels, along with the Create from Selection shortcut, to name multiple ranges quickly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Ads purchased. Enter any values in the Number_ads_purchased range. These are the only decision variable cells for this model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Exposures obtained. The numbers of ads purchased determine the numbers of exposures to the various viewer groups. To calculate these exposures, enter the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B6:I6,Number_ads_purchased)<br /> in cell B23 and copy it down to cell B28.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Total cost. The quantities of ads purchased also determine the total cost of advertising. Calculate this cost in cell B31 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B14:I14,Number_ads_purchased)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The main Solver dialog box appears in Figure 4.3. After filling it out as shown and checking the Non-Negative option and selecting the Simplex LP method, click the Solve button to obtain the solution shown in Figure 4.2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution is probably not the one you would have guessed. With a set of ads that cost very different amounts and reach very different mixes of viewers, it is difficult to guess the optimal strategy. For comparison, however, we calculated the total number of exposures from each type of ad in row 12 and divided the costs in row 14 by the numbers of exposures in row 12 to obtain the cost per million exposures in row 15. You might expect the ads with low cost per million exposures to be chosen most frequently. However, this is not necessarily the case. For example, “Sunday Night Football” has the second-lowest cost per million exposures, but the optimal solution doesn’t include any ads for this show.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> Solver’s sensitivity report, shown in Figure 4.4, is enlightening for this solution. Here is a sample of the information it provides.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ The company is not currently purchasing any ads on “Timeless.” The reduced cost for this show implies that the cost per ad would have to decrease by at least 10 ($10,000) before it would be optimal to purchase any ads on this show.<br /> ■ The company is currently purchasing about 20 ads on “SportsCenter.” The allowable increase and decrease for this show indicate how much the cost per ad would have to change before the optimal number of ads on the show would change. For example, if the price per ad increased above 9 1 0.762 ($9762), the company might purchase fewer than 20 ads. How many fewer? You would have to rerun Solver to know.<br /> ■ The constraint on exposures to men in the 36–55 age range has the largest shadow price, 15.000. If the company relaxed this constraint to require only 59 million exposures,<br /> it would save $15,000 in total advertising cost. On the other side, if the company required 61 million exposures to this group, rather than 60 million, its cost would increase by $15,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>A Dual-Objective Extension of the Model</strong><br /> This advertising model can be extended in a very natural way. General Flakes really has two competing objectives: (1) to obtain as many exposures as possible, and (2) to keep the total advertising cost as low as possible. In the original model, we decided to minimize total cost and constrain the exposures to be at least as large as a required level. An alternative is to maximize the total number of excess exposures and put a budget constraint on total cost. Here, excess exposures are those above the minimal required level.<br /> To implement this alternative, which is shown in Figure 4.5 (see the file Advertising 2 Big Picture.xlsx), only minor modifications to the original model are necessary. These<br /> appear in Figure 4.6 and the file Advertising 2 Finished.xlsx. You can do this with the following steps:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Excess exposures. For each viewer group, calculate the number of excess exposures by entering the formula<br /> =B23-D23</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell F23 and copying it down. Then sum these in cell B35 with the SUM function. This cell becomes the new objective cell to maximize.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Budget constraint. Calculate the total cost exactly as before, but now constrain it to be less than or equal to a given budget in cell D32.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Solver dialog box. Modify the Solver dialog box as shown in Figure 4.7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At this point, you are probably wondering where the budget of $2 million in Figure 4.6 comes from. This requires some explanation of the solution strategy in this extension of the original model. The basic assumption is that the company has two objectives: to maximize total excess exposures and to minimize total cost. Unfortunately, it is impossible to do both because they are pulling in different directions. When you have a dual-objective problem such as this, you typically use one of the objectives as the objective cell and constrain the other. Here, the company is asking how many excess exposures it can get for a given budget. There is no natural budget to use, and it makes perfect sense to ask questions such as these: How many exposures can the company get for $1.9 million? How many for $2.0 million? How many for $2.1 million?</p>
 <p class="blog">
Fortunately, SolverTable is the perfect tool to answer all of these questions in one step. You first develop the model as in Figure 4.6, using any budget such as $2.0 million in cell D32, and run Solver in the usual way. Then you run a one- way SolverTable, allowing the budget to vary over some desired range, and keep track of selected output variables. Typical results appear in Figure 4.8, which are based on the SolverTable settings in Figure 4.9. For low budget levels, the problem is infeasible—there is no way with this budget to obtain the required exposures. Above a certain budget level, the problem becomes feasible, and the optimal solutions are shown. As the budget increases, the company can clearly obtain larger numbers of excess exposures, but the optimal advertising strategy in columns B through I changes in a somewhat unpredictable way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results of this sensitivity analysis can be shown graphically in a trade-off curve, as in Figure 4.10. (The data range for this SolverTable chart was modified to not include the top two infeasible rows.) This chart illustrates the rather obvious fact that when the company is allowed to spend more on advertising, it can achieve more total excess exposures.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Integer Constraints</strong><br /> The two advertising models to this point have allowed noninteger values in the decision variable cells. In reality, this is not allowed; the company cannot purchase, say, 6.313 ads on “Madam Secretary.” It must purchase integer numbers of ads. Given this, your first instinct is probably<br /> to round the optimal values in the decision variable cells to the nearest integers to obtain the optimal integer solution. Unfortunately, this can have unpredictable results. First, the rounded solution might not be feasible. Second, even if it is feasible, it might not be the optimal integer solution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
have unpredictable results. First, the rounded solution might not be feasible. Second, even if it is feasible, it might not be the optimal integer solution. Although all of Chapter 6 is devoted to special types of integer programming models—those with integer constraints on at least some of the decision variable cells—we can preview the topic here. In fact, from a user’s standpoint, there isn’t much to it. To force the decision variable cells to have integer values, you simply add another constraint in the Solver dialog box, as shown in Figure 4.11. In the left text box, select the decision variable cell range. In the middle text box, select int (for integer). The right text box then automatically contains the word Integer. When you eventually click Solve, you get the optimal integer solution shown in Figure 4.12. Consider the following about this integer solution:<br /> ■ The total cost in the objective cell is now worse (larger) than before. This illustrates the general rule that when any additional constraints are imposed, including integer constraints, the objective can only get worse or remain the same; it can never get better.<br /> ■ The optimal integer solution is not the rounded noninteger solution. In fact, it isn’t even close. (Compare the before and after “Homeland” and “SportsCenter” values, for example.) Rounding noninteger solutions sometimes works, and sometimes it doesn’t. Using Solver with explicit integer constraints is always preferable.</p>

■ When there are integer constraints, Solver uses an algorithm—called branch and bound—that is significantly different from the simplex method. (Actually, the simplex method is still used to solve subproblems, but we won’t discuss the details here.) Integer- constrained models are typically much harder to solve than models without integer constraints. Although this small model still solves in a fraction of a second, larger integer models can take minutes or even hours of solution time.<br /> ■ If the model is linear except for the integer constraints—that is, it satisfies the proportionality and additivity assumptions of linear models—you should still select the Simplex LP method.</p>

<strong>Solver Tip</strong>: Integer Constraints Ignored<br /> If you add integer constraints and the Solver solution doesn’t give you integers, you probably need to change a Solver setting. In the Solver dialog box, click Options. In the All Methods tab, the chances are that the “Ignore Integer Constraints” box is checked. You should uncheck it and run Solver again.</p>

<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> The advertising model has one weakness, at least for realistic applications. Perhaps you have already spotted it: double-counting. Suppose a company runs three ads for the same product on a “Sunday Night Football” telecast. Also, suppose that the rating service claims that an ad reaches, say, six million men age 18–35. How many total exposures do these three ads reach for this viewer group? Our model claims that it reaches 3(6) = 18 million. However, the effective number of exposures is probably lower than 18 million, for the simple reason that many of the same men are watching all three ads. Arguably, it is more beneficial for an ad to be seen once by three different people than for an ad to be seen three times by the same person.<br /> This presents two difficulties for the modeler. First, it is probably difficult to estimate the effective number of exposures to any viewer group when an ad is run multiple times on the same show. Second, even if a company can obtain such estimates, it faces a nonlinear model, as discussed in Chapter 7. This is because the proportionality assumption of LP no longer holds. Specifically, each extra ad on a given show reaches a decreasing number of new exposures. We will revisit this model in Chapter 7.</p>

2:From here on, to save space we typically show only the optimal solution. However, remember that when you develop a spreadsheet optimization model, you can enter any values in the decision variable cells initially. Solver will eventually find the optimal solution.</p>
