            <p class="blog">Diauxic growth is a term to describe the sequential use of two different carbon-energy sources. Industrially, diauxic growth is observed when fermenting a mixture of sugars, such as those obtained from the hydrolysis of biomass. The classic example of diauxic growth is growth of E. coli on a glucose-lactose mixture. Observations on this system led to formulation of the operon hypothesis and the basis for a Nobel prize (for J. Monod and F. Jacob). Consider the plot in Fig. 11.14, where the utilization of glucose and lactose and the growth of a culture are depicted for a batch culture (batch reactor). As we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 11, the amount of biomass in a culture, X, accumulates exponentially. Note that at 2 h after inoculation, cells are growing rapidly, glucose is being consumed, and lactose is not being utilized. At 7 h, cell mass accumulation is zero. All the glucose has been consumed. At 10 h the culture is growing and lactose is being consumed, but the rate of growth (cell mass accumulation) is less than at 2 h. Explain what is happening with intracellular control to account for the observations at 2, 7, and 10 h. What rate of β -galactosidase formation would you expect to find in the culture at these times in comparison to the basal rate (which is &lt; 1% of the maximum rate)?</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/07/11.1.1.png"></div>

At 2 h the lac operon is fully induced, since lactose converted to allolactose combines with the lac i repressor protein, inactivating it. With the repressor protein deactivated, RNA polymerase is free to bind to the promoter, but does so inefficiently. Glucose levels are still high, which results in higher levels of ATP and low levels of AMP and cAMP. Consequently, little cAMP-CAP complex is formed, and the interaction of the lac promoter with RNA polymerase is weak in the absence of cAMP-CAP. The rate of β-galactosidase formation would be slightly increased from the basal level—perhaps 5% of the maximal rate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At 7 h the glucose has been fully consumed. The cell cannot generate energy, and the level of ATP decreases and cAMP increases. The cAMP-CAP complex level is high, which increases the efficiency of binding RNA polymerase to the lac promoter. This increased binding leads to increased transcription and translation. The rate of β-galactosidase formation is maximal and much higher than the basal rate or the 2 h rate. However, the cells have not yet accumulated sufficient intracellular concentrations of β-galactosidase and lac permease to allow efficient use of lactose and rapid growth.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At 10 h the intracellular content of proteins made from the lac operon is sufficiently high to allow maximal growth on lactose. However, this growth rate on lactose is slower than on glucose, since lactose utilization generates energy less efficiently. Consequently, the cAMP level remains higher than when the cell was growing on glucose. The level of production of β-galactosidase is thus higher than the basal or 2 h level.</p>
