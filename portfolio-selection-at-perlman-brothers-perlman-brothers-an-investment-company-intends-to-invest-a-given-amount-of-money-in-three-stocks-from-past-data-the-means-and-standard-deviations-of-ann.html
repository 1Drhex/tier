The variables and constraints for this model appear in Figure 7.43. (See the file Portfolio Selection Big Picture.xlsx.) One interesting aspect of this model is that you do not have to specify the amount of money invested—it could be $100, $1000, $1,000,000, or any other amount. The model determines investment weights, the fractions of this amount to invest in the various stocks, and these weights are then relevant for any investment amount. The only requirement is that the weights sum to 1, so that all of the money is invested. Besides this, the weights should be nonnegative to prevent shorting stocks<span class="tex-text">\(.^{12}\)</span> The mean return from the portfolio should also be at least as large as the specified minimal required mean return.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The following are the individual steps required (see Figure 7.44 and the file Portfolio Selection Finished.xlsx):<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the inputs in the light blue ranges. These include the estimates of means, standard deviations, and correlations, as well as the minimal required mean return.<br /> 2) Investment weights. Enter any trial values in the Investment_weights range for the fractions of the company’s money placed in the three investments. Then sum these with the SUM function in cell B19.<br /> 3) Mean annual return. Use Equation (7.7) to calculate the mean portfolio return in cell B23 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B5:D5,Investment_weights)<br /> 4) Covariance matrix. Equation (7.9) should be used to calculate the portfolio variance. To do this, you must first calculate a matrix of covariances. Using the general formula for covariance, <span class="tex-text">\(c_{ij}= r_{ij} s_{i} s_{j}\)</span> (which holds even when i = j because <span class="tex-text">\(r_{ij}= 1\)</span>), you can calculate these from the inputs with lookups. Specifically, enter the formula<br /> =HLOOKUP($F9,$B$4:$D$6,3)*B9*HLOOKUP(G$8,$B$4:$D$6,3)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Estimated variance of <span class="tex-text">\(R_{p} = \sum\limits_{ij}{c_{ij}x_{i}x_{j} }\)</span> (7.9)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell G9, and copy it to the range G9:I11. (This formula is a bit tricky, so take a close look at it. The term B9 captures the relevant correlation. The two HLOOKUP terms capture the appropriate standard deviations.)<br /> 5) Portfolio variance. Although the mathematical details are not discussed here, it can be shown that the summation in Equation (7.9) is really the product of three matrices: a row of investment weights, the covariance matrix, and a column of investment weights. To calculate it, enter the formula<br /> =MMULT(Investment_weights,MMULT(G9:I11,TRANSPOS E(Investment_weights)))<br /> in cell B25 and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. (Remember that Excel puts curly brackets around this formula when you press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. You should not type these curly brackets.) Note that this formula uses two MMULT functions. Again, this is because MMULT can multiply only two matrices at a time. Therefore, you first multiply the last two matrices and then multiply this product by the first matrix.<br /> 6) Portfolio standard deviation. Most financial analysts talk in terms of portfolio variance. However, it is probably more intuitive to talk about portfolio standard deviation because it is in the same units as the returns. Calculate the standard deviation in cell B26 with the formula<br /> =SQRT(Portfolio_variance)<br /> Actually, either cell B25 or B26 can be used as the objective cell to minimize. Minimizing the square root of a function is equivalent to minimizing the function itself.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The completed Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 7.45. The constraints specify that the mean portfolio return must be at least as large as the minimum required mean return, and all of the company’s money must be invested. The investment weights are constrained to be nonnegative (to avoid short selling), but because of the squared terms in the variance formula, the GRG Nonlinear method must be used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 7.44 indicates that the company should put half of its money in each of stocks 1 and 3, and it should not invest in stock 2 at all. This might be somewhat surprising, given that the ranking of riskiness of the stocks is 1, 2, 3, with stock 1 being the most risky but also having the highest expected return. However, the correlations play an important role in portfolio selection, so it is not usually easy to guess the optimal portfolio on the basis of the means and standard deviations of stock returns alone.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The portfolio standard deviation of 0.1217 can be interpreted in a probabilistic sense. Specifically, if stock returns are approximately normally distributed, then the probability is about 0.68 that the actual portfolio return will be within one standard deviation of the mean return, and the probability is about 0.95 that the actual portfolio return will be within two standard deviations of the mean return. Given that the mean return is 0.12, this implies a lot of risk—two standard deviations below this mean is a negative return (or loss) of slightly more than 12%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> The constraints for this model are linear, and it can be shown that the portfolio variance is a convex function of the investment weights. Therefore, the Solver solution is guaranteed to be optimal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> This model begs for a sensitivity analysis on the minimum required mean return. When the company requires a larger mean return, it must incur a larger risk, as shown in Figure 7.46. You can use SolverTable with cell D23 as the single input cell, allowing it to vary from 0.10 to 0.14 in increments of 0.005. Note that values outside this range are of no interest. Stock 3 has the lowest mean return, 0.10, and stock 1 has the highest mean return, 0.14, so no portfolio can have a mean return outside of this range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results indicate that the company should put more and more into risky stock 1 as the required expected return increases—and stock 2 continues to be unused. The accompanying scatter chart (with the option to connect the points) shows the risk-return trade-off. As the company assumes more risk, as measured by portfolio standard deviation, the mean return increases, but at a decreasing rate.<br /> The curve in this chart is called the efficient frontier. Points on the efficient frontier can be achieved by appropriate portfolios. Points below the efficient frontier can be achieved, but they are not as good as points on the efficient frontier because they have a lower mean return for a given level of risk. In contrast, points above the efficient frontier are unachievable—the company cannot achieve a mean return this high for a given level of risk. An investor typically chooses a point on the efficient frontier that is most appropriate for his or her attitude toward risk.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. Typical real-world portfolio selection problems involve a large number of potential investments, certainly many more than three. This admittedly requires more input data, particularly for the correlation matrix, but the basic model does not change at all. In particular, the matrix formula for portfolio variance shows the power of using Excel’s matrix functions. Without them, the formula for portfolio variance would be a long involved sum.<br /> 2. If Perlman is allowed to short a stock, the investment weight for that stock should be allowed to be negative. To implement this, you should eliminate the nonnegativity constraints on the investment weights.<br /> 3. An alternative objective is to minimize the probability that the portfolio loses money. You are asked to explore this possibility in one of the problems.<br /> 4. Sometimes analysts use a “scenario approach” to portfolio analysis as an alternative to the approach used here. See the file Portfolio Scenario Finished.xlsx (in the Extra Examples folder) for an example of how this works.<br /> 5. There are no transactions costs in Perlman’s model. Suppose that for every $1 traded in stock 1 or 2, Perlman must pay $0.01, and for every dollar traded in stock 3, it must pay $0.005. Also, suppose the company begins with 10% of its money invested in stock 1, 40% in stock 2, and 50% in stock 3. The file Portfolio Transactions Finished.xlsx (in the Extra Examples folder)illustrates how the transactions costs from buying and selling can be accounted for in the model.</p>
