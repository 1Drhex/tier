            <p class="blog">Paying for the Speed-Skating Oval<br /> Northern Heights wants to sponsor the Winter Olympics. A speed-skating oval must be added to its existing facilities. Which alternative, the Ice Palace or the temporary inflatable, is better?</p> <p class="blog">Since political support is crucial, allocate the costs to the various uses. The two alternatives are a permanent and a temporary facility.<br /> 1. Construct a permanent Ice Palace for later use by residents, tourists, and local colleges. A permanent ice rink in the oval’s middle will be a practice rink for the figure skaters. Use of the practice rink will save $4M in operating and security costs for alternate practice facilities. Moveable bleachers can be placed on the rink during the speed-skating competition or, after the Olympics, on the oval during rink events.<br /> 2. Construct a temporary speed-skating oval in an inflatable building. After the Olympics, convert the oval to a cinder track for spring, summer, and fall use by the local schools and colleges. No practice rink is included.<br /> Northern Heights’s interest rate is 10%. The temporary facility would be up for 1 year (there is also an intercollegiate competition scheduled then). The Ice Palace and the cinder track have no salvage value after the 40-year study period (assume 39 years of use and 1 year of competition). (Note: Both alternatives have the same $3M cost of operations for the year of competition, so it can be ignored.)</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="429"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="209"></td> <td width="78">Ice Palace</td> <td width="142">Temporary Inflatable &amp; Cinder Track</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Facility cost</td> <td>$20M</td> <td>$5M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Salvage value after competition</td> <td>0</td> <td>1M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Extra practice rink costs</td> <td>0</td> <td>4M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Annual operating cost</td> <td>1M</td> <td>50,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Supporters of the Ice Palace will provide at least two justifications. First, the fancier facility will be more attractive to the International Olympic Committee. Nothern Heights will then have a higher probability of being selected as the host city. Second, the Ice Palace as a unique facility will add more to the community than would the cinder track. Detractors will emphasize that the Ice Palace costs far more. The ability of boosters to “sell” the Ice Palace may hinge on the allocation of Ice Palace costs between the Olympics (Oly.) and Northern Heights (NH).<br /> The costs of the temporary facility and the cinder track are easy to allocate respectively to the Olympics and Northern Heights. The Olympics are charged the cost of the facility and the extra practice rink costs, and credited the salvage value for the inflatable building. Northern Heights incurs a cost of $50,000 per year for 39 years.</p>

 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{Oly}}=-5 \mathrm{M}+(-4 \mathrm{M}+1 \mathrm{M}) / 1.1=-\$ 7.73 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{NH}}=-50 \mathrm{~K}(P / A, .1,39)(P / F, .1,1)=-\$ .44 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Ice Palace’s first cost must be allocated between the Olympics and Northern Heights. At one extreme, Northern Heights might claim that the Olympics should account for all capital costs. The resulting allocation is:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{Oly}}=-\$ 20 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{NH}}=1 \mathrm{M}(P / A, .1,39) / 1.1=-\$ 8.87 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This implies that the Olympics budget should pay for 100% of the capital costs for the Ice Palace.<br /> At the other extreme, the Olympics might claim that Northern Heights should pay all costs over and above those of the temporary facility and the practice rink savings, since the permanence is for Northern Heights’s 39 years of future use. The resulting allocation is:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{Oly}}=-\$ 7.73 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\mathrm{PW}_{\mathrm{NH}}=-20 \mathrm{M}+7.73 \mathrm{M}-8.87 \mathrm{M}=-\$ 21.14 \mathrm{M}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
This would allocate 38.65% of the Ice Palace’s capital costs to the Olympics and $12.27M, or 61.35%, to Northern Heights. In both cases, the total PW for the costs is $28.87M.<br /> The cinder track’s PW is -$20.70M larger. However, if the Ice Palace increases the probability of becoming the Olympics host city or its benefits are large enough, then the Ice Palace may be better. From the local perspective, the two allocations are over $12M different. This difference represents benefits that would have to be generated for the Ice Palace to be worthwhile.</p>
