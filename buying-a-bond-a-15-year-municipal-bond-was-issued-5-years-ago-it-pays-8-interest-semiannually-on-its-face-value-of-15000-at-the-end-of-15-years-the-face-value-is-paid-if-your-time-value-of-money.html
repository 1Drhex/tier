The first 5 years are past, and there are 20 more semiannual payments. The price you should offer is the PW of the cash flows that will be received if the bond is purchased. The semiannual interest is 4% of $15,000, or $600. Thus, the cash flows are $600 at the ends of each semiannual period for years 6 through 15 and an additional $15,000 in year 15. In the cash flow diagram, the periods are labeled as the number of periods from now.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the $600 in interest is received semiannually, the effective interest rate, i, must be converted to a semiannual rate. Using Equation 2.3(<span class="tex-text">\(i=(1+r / M)^{M}-1\)</span>):</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left(1+i_{2}\right)^{2}\)</span>=1 + i = 1.1236<br /> (1 + <span class="tex-text">\(i_{2}\)</span>) = 1.06</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(i_{2}\)</span> = 6%<br /> PW = 600(P/A, 6%,10) + 15,000(P/F, 6%,20)<br /> = 600 × 11.470 + 15,000 × .3118 = $11,559</p>
 <p class="blog">
The $11,559 is the discounted price—that is, the PW at 12.36% of the cash flows from the $15,000 bond. The $3441 discount raises the investment’s rate of return from a nominal 8% for the face value to 12.36% on an investment of $11,559.<br /> This example also illustrates why it is better to separately state cash flows. At the end of period 20 from now (or year 15), there are two cash flows, $600 and $15,000. The $600 is part of the 20-period uniform series, and the $15,000 is a single cash flow. All of these numbers come directly from the problem statement. If the two final cash flows are combined into $15,600, then the $600 uniform series has only 19 periods—and it is easy to err and forget that change.</p>
