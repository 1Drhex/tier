            <p class="blog">A contractor has signed a contract to pour the footing, foundation, and slab floor for a building. The contractor uses the cost codes in Figure C (at the end of this chapter) . The original estimate for the labor to com-plete the footing and foundation was $8,400 and the con-tractor has subcontracted this work out for $8,560. The subcontractor has billed the contractor for $2,700 for this work. No additional cost commitments are expected to be made for this line item. The original estimate for concrete to complete the footings and foundation is $9,270, no costs have been committed, and the contractor has received a bill for $3,960. The contractor estimates that it will cost an additional $5,310 to purchase the remaining concrete for the footings and foundations. The original estimate for the labor to complete the slab floor is $20,000 and a $100 change order has been approved for additional work. This work will be performed by in-house crews.<br /> The work has yet to be performed and the contractor es-timates that the cost to complete the work is $20,100. The original estimate for the concrete to complete the slab floor is $23,456 and a $118 change order has been approved for additional work. The work has yet to be<br /> performed, but the contractor has been given a 1% price discount for the slab concrete from the supplier, which reduces the total estimate for this item by 1%. Determine the total estimated cost at completion for the project and the variance for each cost code.</p>

The original estimate for the labor to complete the footings and foundation is $8,400. The total estimate (Column E) for the labor to complete the footings and foun-dation equals the original estimate (Column C) because no change orders have been issued. Because the contrac-tor has hired a subcontractor for this work, the committed costs (Column F) are $8,560, of which $2,700 have been in-voiced (Column G). The total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Committed and Noncommitted Costs<br /> = $8,560 + $0 + $8,560</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total estimated cost at completion is equal to the total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) because the estimated cost to complete (Column J) is zero. The vari-ance (Column L) is equal to the total estimated cost at com-pletion (Column K) less the total estimate (Column E) and is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Variance = $8,560 &#8211; $8,400 = $160</p>
 <p class="blog">
This variance indicates that there is a cost overrun of $160 for this line item.<br /> The original estimate for the concrete to complete the foot-ings and foundation is $9,270. The total estimate (Column E) for the concrete to complete the footings and foundation equals the original estimate (Column C) because no change orders have been issued. Because no costs have been committed, the committed costs (Column F) are $0. The invoiced costs are noncommitted costs; therefore, the noncommitted costs invoiced (Column H) are $3,960. The total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Committed and Noncommitted Costs<br /> = $0 + $3,960 = $3,960</p>
 <p class="blog">
The estimated cost to complete (Column J) is $5,310. The total estimated cost at completion (Column K) is equal to the total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) plus the estimated cost to complete (Column J) and is cal-culated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Estimated Cost at Completion<br /> = $3,960 + $5,310 = $9,270</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the total estimated cost at completion is equal to the total estimate, the variance (Column L) is zero. This cost item is neither over nor under budget.<br /> For the labor to complete the slab floor, the total esti-mate (Column E) equals the original estimate (Column C) plus the change orders (Column D) and is calculated<br /> as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Estimate = $20,000 + $100 = $20,100</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the work is being performed in-house, the costs are still unknown and are noncommitted costs. Because the costs have not occurred, the noncommitted costs invoiced (Column H) are zero. The company estimates that the esti-mated cost to complete (Column J) is $20,100. The total estimated cost at completion (Column K) is equal to the total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) plus the estimated cost to complete (Column J) and is cal-culated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Estimated Cost at Completion<br /> = $0 + $20,100 = $20,100</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the total estimated cost at completion is equal to the total estimate, the variance is zero. This cost item is nei-ther over nor under budget.<br /> For the concrete to complete the slab floor, the total estimate (Column E) equals the original estimate (Column C) plus the change orders (Column D) and is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Estimate = $23,456 + $118 = $23,574</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because the work has yet to be performed and the actual quantity of concrete has not been determined, the costs are still unknown and are noncommitted costs. Because<br /> the costs have not occurred, the noncommitted costs in-voiced (Column H) are zero. The company has received a 1% discount from the supplier that is reflected in the<br /> estimated cost to complete (Column J) and is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Estimated Cost to Complete = $23,574(1-1/100)<br /> Estimated Cost to Complete = $23,338</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total estimated cost at completion (Column K) is equal to the total committed and noncommitted costs (Column I) plus the estimated cost to complete (Column J) and is cal-culated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total Estimated Cost at Completion = $0 + $23,338<br /> Total Estimated Cost at Completion = $23,338</p>
 <p class="blog">
The variance (Column L) is equal to the total estimated cost at completion (Column K) less the total estimate (Column E) and is calculated as follows: Variance = $23,574 &#8211; $23,338 = $236</p>
 <p class="blog">
This variance indicates that there is a cost underrun of $236 for this line item.<br /> The total of each of the columns may then be summed for a project total. For the project, the variance is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Variance = $160 + $0 + $0 + (-$236) = -$76</p>
 <p class="blog">
We see that the project has a projected cost savings of $76. The solution using a spreadsheet is found in Figure 2 .</p>
