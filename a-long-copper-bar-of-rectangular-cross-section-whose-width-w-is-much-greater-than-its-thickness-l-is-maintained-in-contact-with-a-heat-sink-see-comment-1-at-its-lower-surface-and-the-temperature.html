where the temperature is a function of position and time, T(x, t). Since this differential equation is second order in the spatial coordinate x and first order in time t, there must be two boundary conditions for the x-direction and one condition, termed the initial condition, for time. The boundary condition at the bottom surface corresponds to case 1 of Table 2.2. In particular, since the temperature of this surface is maintained at a value, <span class="tex-text">\(T_{o}\)</span>, which is fixed with time, it follows that</p>

The initial condition is inferred from recognition that, before the change in conditions, the<br /> bar is at a uniform temperature <span class="tex-text">\(T_{o}\)</span>. Hence</p>

If <span class="tex-text">\(T_{0},T_{\infty },\dot{q}\)</span>, and h are known, Equations 1 through 4 may be solved to obtain the timevarying temperature distribution T(x, t) following imposition of the electric current.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comments:<br /> 1. The heat sink at x = 0 could be maintained by exposing the surface to an ice bath or by attaching it to a cold plate. A cold plate contains coolant channels machined in a solid of large thermal conductivity (usually copper). By circulating a liquid (usually water) through the channels, the plate and hence the surface to which it is attached may be maintained at a nearly uniform temperature.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. The temperature of the top surface T(L, t) will change with time. This temperature is an unknown and may be obtained after finding T(x, t).</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. We may use our physical intuition to sketch temperature distributions in the bar at selected times from the beginning to the end of the transient process. If we assume that <span class="tex-text">\(T_{\infty }&gt; T_{0}\)</span> and that the electric current is sufficiently large to heat the bar to temperatures in excess of <span class="tex-text">\(T_{âˆž}\)</span>, the following distributions would correspond to the initial condition (t â‰¤ 0), the final (steady-state) condition (t â†’ âˆž), and two intermediate times. Note how the distributions comply with the initial and boundary conditions. What is a special feature of the distribution labeled (b)?</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Our intuition may also be used to infer the manner in which the heat flux varies with time at the surfaces (x = 0, L) of the bar. On <span class="tex-text">\(q_{x}^{&#039;&#039;}-t\)</span> coordinates, the transient variations are as follows. Convince yourself that the foregoing variations are consistent with the temperature distributions of Comment 3. For t â†’ âˆž, how are <span class="tex-text">\(q_{x}^{&#039;&#039;}(0)\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(q_{x}^{&#039;&#039;}\)</span>(L) related to the volumetric rate of energy generation?</p>
