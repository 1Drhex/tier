            <p class="blog"><strong> Decision Trees</strong></p> <p class="blog">The owner of Hackers Computer Store is considering what to do with his business over the next five years. Sales growth over the past couple of years has been good, but sales could grow substantially if a major proposed electronics firm is built in his area. Hackers’ owner sees three options. The first is to enlarge his current store, the second is to locate at a new site, and the third is to simply wait and do nothing. The process of expanding or moving would take little time, and, therefore, the store would not lose revenue. If nothing were done the first year and strong growth occurred, then the decision to expand could be reconsidered. Waiting longer than one year would allow competition to move in and would make expansion no longer feasible.</p> <p class="blog">The assumptions and conditions are as follows:<br /> 1. Strong growth as a result of the increased population of computer fanatics from the new electronics firm has a 55 percent probability.<br /> 2. Strong growth with a new site would give annual returns of $195,000 per year. Weak growth with a new site would mean annual returns of $115,000.<br /> 3. Strong growth with an expansion would give annual returns of $190,000 per year. Weak growth with an expansion would mean annual returns of $100,000.<br /> 4. At the existing store with no changes, there would be returns of $170,000 per year if there is strong growth and $105,000 per year if growth is weak.<br /> 5. Expansion at the current site would cost $87,000.<br /> 6. The move to the new site would cost $210,000.<br /> 7. If growth is strong and the existing site is enlarged during the second year, the cost would still be $87,000.<br /> 8. Operating costs for all options are equal.</p>

We construct a decision tree to advise Hackers’ owner on the best action. Exhibit 5.3 shows the decision tree for this problem. There are two decision points (shown with the square nodes) and three chance occurrences (round nodes).<br /> The values of each alternative outcome shown on the right of the diagram in Exhibit 5.4 are calculated as follows.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 1535px;height: 125px" border="0" width="256" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt;width: 48pt" align="left" width="64" height="19">Alternative</td> <td style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">Revenue</td> <td style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">Cost</td> <td style="width: 48pt" align="left" width="64">Value</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Move to new location, strong growth</td> <td align="left">$195,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$210,000</td> <td align="left">$765,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Move to new location, weak growth</td> <td align="left">$115,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$210,000</td> <td align="left">$365,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Expand store, strong growth</td> <td align="left">$190,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$87,000</td> <td align="left">$863,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Expand store, weak growth</td> <td align="left">$100,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$87,000</td> <td align="left">$413,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Do nothing now, strong growth, expand next year</td> <td align="left">$170,000 × 1 yr + $190,000 × 4 yrs</td> <td align="left">$87,000</td> <td align="left">$843,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Do nothing now, strong growth, do not expand next year</td> <td align="left">$170,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$0</td> <td align="left">$850,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" align="left" height="19">Do nothing now, weak growth</td> <td align="left">$105,000 × 5 yrs</td> <td align="left">$0</td> <td align="left">$525,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Working from the rightmost alternatives, which are associated with the decision of whether to expand, we see that the alternative of doing nothing has a higher value than the expansion alternative. We therefore eliminate the expansion in the second year alternatives. What this means is that if we do nothing in the first year and we experience strong growth, then in the second year it makes no sense to expand.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we can calculate the expected values associated with our current decision alternatives. We simply multiply the value of the alternative by its probability and sum the values. The expected value for the alternative of moving now is $585,000. The expansion alternative has an expected value of $660,500, and doing nothing now has an expected value of $703,750. Our analysis indicates that our best decision is to do nothing (both now and next year)!</p>
 <p class="blog">
Due to the five-year time horizon, it may be useful to consider the time value of the revenue and cost streams when solving this problem. If we assume a 16 percent interest rate, the first alternative outcome (move now, strong growth) has a discounted revenue valued at $428,487 (195,000 × 3.274293654) minus the $210,000 cost to move immediately. Exhibit 5.5 shows the analysis considering the discounted flows. Details of the calculations are given as follows. The present value table in Appendix E can be used to look up the discount factors. In order to make our calculations agree with those completed by Excel—in Excel, calculate the<span class="tex-text">\( discount factor = (1 + interest rate)^{(– years)} \)</span>—we have used discount factors that are calculated to 10 digits of precision. The only calculation that is a little tricky is the one for revenue when we do nothing now and expand at the beginning of next year. In this case, we have a revenue stream of $170,000 the first year, followed by four years at $190,000. The first part of the calculation (170,000 × .862068966) discounts the first-year revenue to the present. The next part (190,000 × 2.798180638) discounts the next four years to the start of year 2. We then discount this four-year stream to the present value.</p>
