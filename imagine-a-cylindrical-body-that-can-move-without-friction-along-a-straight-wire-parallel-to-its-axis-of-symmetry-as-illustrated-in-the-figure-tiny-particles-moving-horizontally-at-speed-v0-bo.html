(i) Early on, particles coming from the right, and rebounding elastically, transmit a greater momentum to the body than those colliding inelastically from the left. For this reason, a resultant force acting to the left accelerates the body. The faster the body moves to the left, the lower the rate at which particles collide with it from the right, and the lower their relative velocity when they do. For those impinging from the left the converse is true, and the net force acting on the body decreases with time.</p>
 <p class="blog">
After a sufficiently long time, the body moves at uniform speed <span class="tex-text">\( v_1 \)</span>. The condition for this equilibrium situation is that, in unit time, the particles impart the same momentum from the right as from the left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The particles from the right reach the body with a relative speed <span class="tex-text">\( v_0 &#8211; v_1 \)</span> and rebound with the same relative speed. In a short time interval <span class="tex-text">\( Δt,\)</span> the particles coming from within a distance of <span class="tex-text">\( (v_0- v_1)Δt \)</span> reach the cylinder, and each imparts an impulse proportional to <span class="tex-text">\( 2(v_0 &#8211; v_1) \)</span> to the body. Thus the force from the right is proportional to <span class="tex-text">\( 2(v_0 &#8211; v_1)^2 \)</span>. Similarly, particles inelastically colliding from the left at a relative speed of <span class="tex-text">\( (v_1 + v_0) \)</span> produce a force proportional to <span class="tex-text">\( (v_0 + v_1)^2. \)</span> The condition for constant speed is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( 2(v_0-v_1)^2=(v_0+v_1)^2, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_1=\frac{\sqrt{2}-1 }{\sqrt{2}+1 }v_0\approx 0.17 \ v_0. \)</span></p>

(ii) Assume that the colliding particles are the molecules of a gas at a certain temperature. If the body continued to move uniformly, even after a very long time, it would imply that a perpetuum mobile (perpetual motion machine) of the second kind were possible, i.e. a heat engine could be built that could continually extract energy from a single heat reservoir. All experience indicates that such an engine cannot be made.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Where is the mistake in the above reasoning? The heat produced by the inelastic collisions has not yet been taken into account! The particles inelastically bombarding the left end of the cylinder heat it up. If the heat so produced is continuously removed (i.e. the body is cooled), then the motion described in part (i) is sustainable. The result is a normal heat engine working between two heat reservoirs, the gas of bombarding particles and the cooling medium.</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, if the body is not cooled, sooner or later it warms up. The molecules forming the sides of the warm body vibrate at the average speed corresponding to its temperature, and the gas particles rebound from it, sometimes at a greater speed, and sometimes at a lower speed, than they would from a colder body. The result is that finally the body cannot absorb any more heat from the gas at either end (or it would warm up further). Then the collisions are effectively elastic on both ends-taking time averages-and so the impulsive forces are equal. Thus, after a very long time, when thermal equilibrium has been reached, the body has to stop.</p>
