<strong>Step 1: Determine the plan dimensions of the pile cap.</strong> The plan dimensions of the pile cap are given in Fig. 10.39. A 3-ft spacing is provided between the piles (including the piles closest to the column and the adjacent piles, which occur on the diagonal), and the edge distance is 1 <span class="tex-text">\(ft^{3}\)</span> in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 2: Determine the thickness of the pile cap</strong>. The thickness of the pile cap is initially determined on the basis of two-way shear requirements at the column. One-way shear requirements will be checked around the column, and one- and two-way shear requirements will be checked around the piles based on this thickness.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total factored axial load on the column is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{u} = (1.2 × 425) + (1.6 × 250) = 910\)</span> kips</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Load per pile = 910/8 = 114 kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assuming that the centers of the two piles closest to the column are located <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile}/2\)</span> = 6 in or more inside the perimeter of the critical section for two-way shear, their contribution to the total shear can be neglected (ACI 15.5.4.2). This assumption will be checked later. Therefore, the factored shear force at the critical section is <span class="tex-text">\(V_{u} = 6 × 114 = 684\)</span> kips.<br /> For an interior square column, the design shear strength is given by ACI Eq. (11-33):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(φV_{c} = φ4λ\sqrt{f &#039;_{c} }b_{o}d = 0.75 × 4 × 1.0 \sqrt { 4,000} × [4 × (22 + d)] × d = 16,697d + 759d^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Equating the required and design shear strengths results in the following equation that can be solved for d:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(759d^{2} + 16,697d − 684,000 = 0\)</span><br /> d = 21.0 in</p>
 <p class="blog">
On the basis of d = 21.0 in, the center of the two piles that are closest to the column is located (43/2) − 18 = 3.5 in inside the section, which is less than <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile}/2 = 6\)</span> in (see Fig. 10.40). Thus, the<br /> initial assumption is not valid; that is, part of the reactions from these two piles must be considered in the shear force at the critical section. By increasing d to 26 in, the center of the piles is located at <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile}/2\)</span> inside the critical section, and these reactions can be neglected.<br /> Try d = 26.0 in<br /> 1. Check shear requirements at the column.</p>
 <ul> <li> <em>Two-way shear</em>: Because the provided effective depth d is greater than that determined for the actual factored shear force, two-way shear requirements are automatically satisfied. Note that with d= 26.0 in , the center of the six piles on the north and south sides of the column is 7.5 in outside of the critical section , which means that the full pile reactions must be considered .</li> <li><em>One &#8211; way shear</em> . For the critical section located a distance d = 26 in from the north or south face of the column , the center of the three piles is located 26 &#8211; ( 31.5 – 11 ) = 5.5 in inside of the critical section , which is less than <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile} \)</span>/ 2 = 6 in ( see Fig . 10.41 ) . ACI 15.5.4.3 permits the magnitude of the pile reaction to be determined by linear inter-polation in this case . At a distance of 26 – ( <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile} / 2 ) = 20\)</span> in from the face of the column , the reactions from the piles are zero . At 26 + ( <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile} / 2 ) = 32\)</span> in from the face of the column , the reaction from each pile is 114 kips . Because the center of the piles is located at 20.5 in from the face of the column , the reaction in each pile is</li> </ul> <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(114\times\left(\frac{20.5}{32-20}-16.67\right) =5\)</span> kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, <span class="tex-text">\(V_{u} = 3 × 5 = 15\)</span> kips.<br /> The design one-way shear strength is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(φV_{c} = φ2λ\sqrt{ f &#039;_{c}} Ld = 0.75 × 2 × 1.0\sqrt {4,000} × 8.5 × 12 × 26/1,000 = 252 kips &gt; 15\)</span> kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the critical section located a distance d = 26 in from the east or west face of the column, the center of the two piles closet to the column is located 26 − 1 − 6 = 19 in inside the critical section; thus, the reactions from these two piles are not considered. Two piles are located 26 − (36 − 11) = 1 in inside of the critical section, which is less than <span class="tex-text">\(d_{pile}\)</span>/2 = 6 in.<br /> The reaction in each pile is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(114\times\left(\frac{25}{32-20}-16.67\right) =48\)</span> kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, <span class="tex-text">\(V_{u} = 2 × 48 = 96\)</span> kips.<br /> The design one-way shear strength is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(φV_{c} = φ2λ\sqrt{f &#039;_{c}} Bd = 0.75 × 2 × 1.0 \sqrt{4,000} × 7.75 × 12 × 26/1,000 = 229 kips &gt; 96\)</span> kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Check shear requirements at the corner pile.</p>
 <ul> <li> Two-way shear: The factored shear force at the critical section is equal to the reaction of the<br /> pile, which is 114 kips (see Fig. 10.42 for the critical shear perimeter).<br /> The design two-way shear strength is<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&lt;br /&gt; \phi V_{c} &amp;=\phi 4 \lambda \sqrt{f_{c}^{\prime}} b_{0} d=0.75 \times 4 \times 1.0 \sqrt{4,000} \times\left[\frac{\pi}{4} \times(12+26)+(2 \times 15)\right] \times 26 / 1,000 \\ &amp;=295 \mathrm{kips}&gt;114 \mathrm{kips} \end{aligned}\)</span>.</li> <li> <em>One-way shear:</em> As in the case for two-way shear, the factored shear force at the critical section for one-way shear is equal to the reaction of the pile, which is 114 kips (see Fig. 10.43 for the<br /> location of the critical section).<br /> The design one-way shear strength is<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(φV_{c} = φ2λ\sqrt{f &#039;_{c}} b_{d} = 0.75 × 2 × 1.0\sqrt{4,000} × (2 × 40.2) × 26/1,000 =\)</span> 198 kips &gt; 114kips</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
3. Check shear requirements at other piles.<br /> The critical sections for two-way shear of the piles closest to the column overlap. Thus, the design two-way shear strength is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(φV_{c} = φ4λ\sqrt{ f &#039;_{c}} b_{o}d = 0.75 × 4 × 1.0 \sqrt{4,000} × 2 ×\left[\frac{\pi}{2} × (12 + 26) + 36\right]× 26/1,000= 944 kips &gt; V_{u} = 2 × 114 =\)</span> 228 kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
The critical sections for two-way shear of the edge piles overlap and are incomplete (i.e., they fall outside of the pile cap). Thus, shear requirements do not control for these piles.<br /> The minimum overall thickness for footings on piles (pile caps) is 16 in (ACI 15.7).<br /> Use a pile cap that is 2 ft 9 in thick (d = 26 inches).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 3: Determine the factored moments</strong>. In the short direction, the factored moment at the critical section (i.e., at the face of the column) is obtained by multiplying the reactions from three piles by the distance from the center of the piles to the critical section:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(M_{u}=(3 × 114) ×\left(\frac{7.75}{2} -1.25- \frac{22}{2\times 12} \right)=584.3\)</span> kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
Similarly, in the long direction,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(M_{u}=114\times\left(1.5-\frac{22}{2\times 12} \right)+(2\times 114)\times \left(3-\frac{22}{2\times 12}\right)=541.5\)</span> ft kips</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 4: Determine the required flexural reinforcement</strong>. The required area of steelis determined using the general principles of the strength design method.<br /> Short direction: <span class="tex-text">\(A_{s} = 0.0019 × (8.5 × 12) × 26 = 5.04 in^{2}&lt; A_{s, min} = 0.0018 × (8.5 × 12) × 33 = 6.06 in^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Providing 11 No. 7 bars satisfies strength requirements (<span class="tex-text">\(A_{s} = 6.60 in^{2}\)</span>). These short bars must be spaced in accordance with ACI 15.4.4.2. The fraction of the total bars that must be distributed uniformly over the band width of 7 ft 9 in is determined by ACI Eq. (15-1):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(γ_{s} = \frac{2}{β + 1} = \frac{2}{(8.5/7.75) + 1} = 0.95\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Provide 10 bars spaced at 9 in on center in the center band, and add one additional bar outside of the center band. Thus, try 12 No. 7 bars in the short direction.<br /> Long direction: <span class="tex-text">\(A_{s} = 0.0020 × (7.75 × 12) × 26 = 4.84 in^{2} &lt; A_{s, min} = 0.0018 × (7.75 × 12) × 33 = 5.52 in^{2}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Try 10 No. 7 bars in the long direction (provided As = 6.00 in2). These bars are spaced uniformly over the width of the pile cap.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 5: Develop the flexural reinforcement.</strong> The flexural reinforcement must be developed in tension a minimum distance of <span class="tex-text">\(\ell_{d}\)</span> past the critical section. Using ACI Eq. (12-1), <span class="tex-text">\(\ell_{d} = 2.1\)</span> ft for the No. 7 bars. The available development length in the short direction is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{7.75}{2} −\frac{ 22}{24} − \frac{3}{12} = 2.7 ft &gt; 2.1\)</span> ft</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, the bars in the short direction can be fully developed. Because the available development length is greater in the long direction, the bars in that direction can be fully developed as well.<br /> Use 12 No 7 bars in the short direction, which are 7 ft 0 in long.<br /> Use 10 No. 7 bars in the long direction, which are 8 ft 0 in long.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 6: Check transfer of forces at the base of the column</strong>. Transfer of forces between the column and the pile cap needs to be checked. In this example, only vertical force transfer needs to be investigated.<br /> Calculations for vertical force transfer have been illustrated in previous examples.</p>
