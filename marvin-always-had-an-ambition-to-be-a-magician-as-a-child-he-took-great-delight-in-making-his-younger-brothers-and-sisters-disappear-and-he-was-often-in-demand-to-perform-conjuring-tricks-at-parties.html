            <p class="blog">Marvin always had an ambition to be a magician. As a child he took great delight in<br /> making his younger brothers and sisters disappear and he was often in demand to perform<br /> conjuring tricks at parties. It was a natural career choice for him when, at the age<br /> of 21, he decided to leave college on 1 July and make his fortune in the world, setting up<br /> in business as a magician. He made the following payments in his first week out of college:<br /> On 1 July he paid £3,000 for a glittering costume with a top hat and cloak; on 2 July<br /> he paid £2,000 for a special edition of a book, ‘The ancient secrets of magic; and on 3 July<br /> he bought four packs of magicians’ playing cards from Kazam Limited for £100 each.<br /> Marvin expected to use these items for many years. He paid cash from his own savings<br /> for the costume and the book, but he agreed that he would pay for the playing cards in a<br /> few weeks’ time from the business bank account.<br /> His first appearance as a magician was on 7 July at the National Magic Show, for<br /> which he was paid a fee of £750 by cheque, with which he opened a business bank<br /> account on the same day. He incurred £20 travel expenses which he again paid from his<br /> own savings.<br /> Required<br /> (a) Prepare a summary of Marvin’s income and expenses for the week ended 7 July.<br /> Ignore any depreciation on Marvin’s assets.<br /> (b) Draw up a list as at 7 July of Marvin’s non-current assets and current assets, then<br /> deduct any current liabilities from the assets. What is Marvin’s equity at that date?<br /> Show how you can prove that the equity figure is correct.</p>

Because of the accounting equation (Assets &#8211; Liabilities = Equity), Marvin’s equity at<br /> 7 July was £5,750</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Proof</strong><br /> Marvin paid for the costume, the book and the travel expenses out of his own private<br /> resources (£3,000 + £2,000 + £20 = £5,020), and the business made a profit during<br /> the week of £730 which increased the value of his equity to £5,750.</p>
