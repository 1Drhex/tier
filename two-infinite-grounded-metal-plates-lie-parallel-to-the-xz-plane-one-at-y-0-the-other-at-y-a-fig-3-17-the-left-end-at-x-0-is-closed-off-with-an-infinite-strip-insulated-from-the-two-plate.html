The configuration is independent of z, so this is really a two-imensional problem.In mathematical terms, we must solve Laplace’s equation,</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\delta ^{2}V}{\delta x^{2}}+\frac{\delta ^{2}V}{\delta y^{2}}=0.\)</span> (3.20)</p>
 <p class="blog">
subject to the boundary conditions</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\begin{cases}(i) V = 0 when y = 0,\\ii) V = 0 when y = a,\\(iii) V = V0(y) when x = 0,\\ (iv) V → 0 as x →∞.\end{cases} \)</span> (3.21)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(The latter, although not explicitly stated in the problem, is necessary on physical grounds: as you get farther and farther away from the “hot” strip at x = 0, the potential should drop to zero.) Since the potential is specified on all boundaries, the answer is uniquely determined. The first step is to look for solutions in the form of products:<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(V(x, y) = X(x)Y (y). \)</span> (3.22)<br /> On the face of it, this is an absurd restriction—the overwhelming majority of solutions to Laplace’s equation do not have such a form. For example, V(x, y) =(5x + 6y) satisfies Eq. 3.20, but you can’t express it as the product of a function x times a function y. Obviously, we’re only going to get a tiny subset of all possible solutions by this means, and it would be a miracle if one of them happened to fit the boundary conditions of our problem . . . But hang on, because the solutions we do get are very special, and it turns out that by pasting them together we can construct the general solution. Anyway, putting Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Y\frac{d^{2}X}{d^{2}x^{2}}+X\frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
The next step is to “separate the variables” (that is, collect all the x-dependence into one term and all the y-dependence into another). Typically, this is accomplished by dividing through by V:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{X} \frac{d^{2}X}{d^{2}x^{2}}+\frac{1}{Y} \frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}}=0 . \)</span> (3.23)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here the first term depends only on x and the second only on y; in other words, we have an equation of the form</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(f (x) + g(y) = 0. \)</span> (3.24)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, there’s only one way this could possibly be true: f and g must both be constant. For what if f (x) changed, as you vary x—then if we held y fixed and fiddled with x, the sum f (x) + g(y) would change, in violation of Eq. 3.24, which says it’s always zero. (That’s a simple but somehow rather elusive argument; don’t accept it without due thought, because the whole method rides on it.) It follows from Eq. 3.23, then, that</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{X} \frac{d^{2}X}{d^{2}x^{2}}=C_{1} and \frac{1}{Y} \frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}}=C_{2} with C_{1}+C_{2}=0. \)</span> (3.25)</p>
 <p class="blog">
One of these constants is positive, the other negative (or perhaps both are zero). In general, one must investigate all the possibilities; however, in our particular problem we need <span class="tex-text">\(C_{1}\)</span> positive and <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2}\)</span> negative, for reasons that will appear in a moment. Thus</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d^{2}X}{d^{2}x^{2}}=k^{2}X, \frac{1}{Y} \frac{d^{2}Y}{dy^{2}}=-k^{2}Y . \)</span> (3.26)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice what has happened: A partial differential equation (3.20) has been converted into two ordinary differential equations (3.26). The advantage of this is obvious—ordinary differential equations are a lot easier to solve. Indeed:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(X(x)=Ae^{kx}+Be^{-kx}, Y(y)=C\sin ky + D\cos ky,\)</span> <p class="blog">
so</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=(Ae^{kx}+Be^{-kx}) (C\sin ky + D\cos ky),\)</span> (3.27)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is the appropriate separable solution to Laplace’s equation; it remains to impose the boundary conditions, and see what they tell us about the constants. To begin at the end, condition (iv) requires that A equal zero.<span class="tex-text">\(^{8}\)</span> Absorbing B into C and D, we are left with</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=e^{-kx} (C\sin ky + D\cos ky),\)</span> <p class="blog">
Condition (i) now demands that D equal zero, so</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=Ce^{-kx} sin ky ,\)</span> (3.28)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Meanwhile (ii) yields sin ka = 0, from which it follows that</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(k=\frac{n \pi }{a} , (n=1,2,3,&#8230;.) \)</span> (3.29)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(At this point you can see why I chose <span class="tex-text">\(C_{1}\)</span> positive and <span class="tex-text">\(C_{2}\)</span> negative: If X were sinusoidal, we could never arrange for it to go to zero at infinity, and if Y were exponential we could not make it vanish at both 0 and a. Incidentally, n = 0 is no good, for in that case the potential vanishes everywhere. And we have already excluded negative n’s.) That’s as far as we can go, using separable solutions, and unless <span class="tex-text">\(V_{0}(y)\)</span> just happens to have the form<span class="tex-text">\( sin(n\pi y/a)\)</span> for some integer n, we simply can’t fit the final boundary condition at x = 0. But now comes the crucial step that redeems the method: Separation of variables has given us an infinite family of solutions (one for each n), and whereas none of them by itself satisfies the final boundary condition, it is possible to combine them in a way that does. aplace’s equation is linear, in the sense that if <span class="tex-text">\(V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}\)</span>, . . . satisfy it, so does any linear combination,<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(V = α_{1}V_{1} + α_{2}V_{2} + α_{3}V_{3} + . . . , where α_{1}, α_{2}, . . .\)</span> are arbitrary constants.<br /> For</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(∇^{2}V=α_{1}∇^{2}V_{1}+α_{1}∇^{2}V_{1}+ . . .= 0α_{1} + 0α_{2} + . . . = 0.\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Exploiting this fact, we can patch together the separable solutions (Eq. 3.28) to construct a much more general solution:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty }{C_{n}e^{-n\pi x/a}\sin (n \pi y/a)}. \)</span> (3.30)</p>
 <p class="blog">
This still satisfies three of the boundary conditions; the question is, can we (by astute choice of the coefficients<span class="tex-text">\( C_{n}\)</span>) fit the final boundary condition (iii)?</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(0,y)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty }{C_{n}\sin (n \pi y/a)}=V_{0}(y). \)</span> (3.31)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Well, you may recognize this sum—it’s a Fourier sine series. And Dirichlet’s theorem<span class="tex-text">\(^{9}\)</span> guarantees that virtually any function <span class="tex-text">\(V_{0}(y)\)</span>—it can even have a finite number of discontinuities—can be expanded in such a series. But how do we actually determine the coefficients<span class="tex-text">\( C_{n}\)</span>, buried as they are in that infinite sum? The device for accomplishing this is so lovely it deserves a name—I call it Fourier’s trick, though it seems Euler had used essentially the same idea somewhat earlier. Here’s how it goes: Multiply Eq. 3.31 by sin<span class="tex-text">\((\acute{n} πy/a)\)</span> (where <span class="tex-text">\(\acute{n}\)</span> is a positive integer), and integrate from 0 to a:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty }{C_{n}\int_{0}^{a}{} \sin (n \pi y/a)\sin (\acute{n }\pi y/a})dy=\int_{0}^{a}{V_{0}(y)\sin (\acute{n}\pi y/a)dy} . \)</span> (3.32)</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can work out the integral on the left for yourself; the answer is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\int_{0}^{a}{} \sin (n \pi y/a)\sin (\acute{n }\pi y/a)dy=\begin{cases} 0, if \acute{n}\neq n, \\ \frac{a}{2}, if \acute{n}\neq n\end{cases} . \)</span> (3.33)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus all the terms in the series drop out, save only the one where <span class="tex-text">\(n =\acute{n}\)</span>, and the left side of Eq. 3.32, reduces to <span class="tex-text">\((a/2)C_{\acute{n}}\)</span> . Conclusion:10</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(C_{n}\frac{2}{a}\int_{0}^{a}{V_{0}(y)\sin (n\pi y/a)dy}. \)</span> (3.34)</p>
 <p class="blog">
That does it: Eq. 3.30 is the solution, with coefficients given by Eq.3.34. As a concrete example, suppose the strip at x = 0 is a metal plate with constant potential<span class="tex-text">\( V_{0}\)</span> (remember, it’s insulated from the grounded plates at y = 0 and y = a). Then</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(C_{n}=\frac{2V_{0}}{a} \int_{0}^{a}{} \sin (n \pi y/a)=\frac{2V_{0}}{n\pi }(1-\cos n\pi ) =\begin{cases} 0, if n is even, \\ \frac{a}{2}, if n is odd\end{cases}. \)</span> (3.35)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=\frac{4V_{0}}{\pi } \sum\limits_{n=1.3.5..}^{}{\frac{1}{n}e^{-n\pi x/a} }\sin(n\pi y/a). \)</span> (3.36)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 3.18 is a plot of this potential; Fig. 3.19 shows how the first few terms in the Fourier series combine to make a better and better approximation to the constant <span class="tex-text">\(V_{0}\)</span>: (a) is n = 1 only, (b) includes n up to 5, (c) is the sum of the first 10 terms, and (d) is the sum of the first 100 terms.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Incidentally, the infinite series in Eq. 3.36 can be summed explicitly (try your hand at it, if you like); the result is</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V(x,y)=\frac{4V_{0}}{\pi }\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin (\pi )}{\sinh (\pi x/a)} \right) .\)</span> (3.37)</p>
 <p class="blog">
In this form, it is easy to check that Laplace’s equation is obeyed and the four boundary conditions (Eq. 3.21) are satisfied.</p>
