(a) Since <em>S</em> is a state function, <em>ΔS</em> depends only on the initial and final states of the system, irrespective of how the system gets from the initial state to the final state. We substitute the ideal gas law and the equation <span class="tex-text">\(dU = C_{V} dT\)</span> into Eq. (3.53) to obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(dS = \frac{1}{T} dU + \frac{p}{T} dV\)</span> (3.53)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(dS = C_{V} \frac{dT}{T} + R\frac{dV}{V},\)</span> (3.56)</p>
 <p class="blog">
which integrates to give</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S = C_{V} \ln \left(T_{2} / T_{1}\right) + R\ln \left(V_{2} / V_{1}\right),\)</span> one mole of ideal gas. (3.57)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) <em> U</em> depends only on <em>T</em> for an ideal gas, so <em>ΔU = 0</em>. Thus from the first law, <em>W = Q</em>. Since the work is quasistatic, <em>W = ∫ p dV</em> where the integral is to be carried out along an isothermal path <span class="tex-text">\(T = T_{1}\)</span>. Therefore we can use <span class="tex-text">\(p = RT_{1}/V\)</span> and take the constants <span class="tex-text">\(RT_{1}\)</span> outside the integral to obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(Q = W = RT_{1} \int_{V_{1} }^{V_{2} }{\frac {dV}{V} = RT_{1} \ln \left(V_{2} / V_{1} \right) }.\)</span> (3.58)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2} = T_{1}\)</span> for this process, part (a) gives <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S = R\ln \left(V_{2} / V_{1} \right) \)</span> so</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S = Q/T_{1}\)</span> (3.59)</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the process is reversible (as expected for quasistatic work). Note that the entropy increases for this reversible process. In this case, entropy increase does not automatically imply irreversibility <em>because the system is not isolated</em>. Similarly, for reversible adiabatic contraction, both <em>Q</em> and <em>ΔS</em> are negative, and the entropy of the system decreases. This does not violate Eq. (3.1) <em>because the system is not isolated</em>.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S \geq 0, isolated system, allowed changes, \)</span> (3.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) <em> W = 0</em> because the outer wall is rigid and there is no way to do mechanical work on the environment of the system. Since <em>Q = 0</em>, we conclude from the first law that <em>ΔU = 0</em>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <em>U</em> depends only on <em>T</em>, we have <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2} = T_{1}\)</span>. (During the process itself, which we shall see is irreversible, <em>T</em> is at best inhomogeneous and probably undefined.) The change in entropy, from part (a), is again <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S = R\ln \left(V_{2} / V_{1}\right) \gt 0.\)</span> Therefore, since <span class="tex-text">\(\delta Q = 0\)</span> at every stage of the process,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S \gt \int{\frac{\delta Q}{T} =0},\)</span> (3.60)</p>
 <p class="blog">
so the process is irreversible as expected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) <em>Q = 0</em> because the system is insulated. The work is quasistatic so <span class="tex-text">\(\delta W = p dV,\)</span> and since <span class="tex-text">\(\delta Q = 0\)</span> at each stage of the process, the first law gives <em>dU + p dV = 0</em>. Since <span class="tex-text">\(dU = C_{V} dT, this becomes C_{V} dT + RT dV/V = 0.\)</span> Division by T (which is not constant in this process) yields <span class="tex-text">\(C_{V} dT/T + R dV/V = 0\)</span> which integrates to give</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(C_{V} \ln \left(T_{2} / T_{1} \right) + R\ln \left(V_{2} / V_{1} \right) = 0.\)</span> (3.61)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus,<em> ΔS = 0</em> and</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\Delta S = \int{\frac{\delta Q}{T} =0, }\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
so the process is reversible and isentropic, as expected for this quasistatic process with adiabatic walls. By means of Eq. (2.27), the final temperature can be written more succinctly as <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2} = T_{1} \left(V_{1} / V_{2} \right) ^{2/3} ,\)</span> so the temperature drops, as expected, for this reversible adiabatic expansion.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(TV^{\gamma -1}=constant\)</span> (2.27)</p>
