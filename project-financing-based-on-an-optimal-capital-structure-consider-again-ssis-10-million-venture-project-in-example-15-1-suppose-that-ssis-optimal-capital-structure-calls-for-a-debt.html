            <p class="blog"><strong>Project Financing Based on an Optimal Capital Structure</strong></p> <p class="blog">Consider again SSI’s $10 million venture project in . Suppose that SSI’s optimal capital structure calls for a debt ratio of 0.5. After reviewing SSI’s capital structure, the investment banker convinced management that it would be better off (in view of current market conditions) to limit the stock issue to $5 million and to raise the other $5 million as debt by issuing bonds. Because the amount of capital to be raised in each category is reduced by half, the flotation cost would also change. The flotation cost for common stock would be 8.1%, whereas the flotation cost for bonds would be 3.2%. As in , the five-year, 12% bond will have a par value of $1,000 and will be sold for $985.</p> <p class="blog">Assuming that the $10 million capital would be raised from the financial market, the engineering department has detailed the following financial information.</p> <ul> <li>The new venture will have a five-year project life.</li> <li>The $10 million capital will be used to purchase land for $1 million, a building for $3 million, and equipment for $6 million. The plant site and building are already available, and production can begin during the first year. The building falls into a 39-year MACRS property class and the equipment into a seven-year MACRS class. At the end of year five, the salvage value of each asset is as follows: the land $1.5 million, the building $2 million, and the equipment $2.5 million.</li> <li>For common stockholders, an annual cash dividend in the amount of $2 per share is planned over the project life. This steady cash-dividend payment is deemed necessary to maintain the market value of the stock.</li> <li>The unit production cost is $50.31 (material, $22.70; labor and overhead (excluding depreciation), $10.57; and tooling, $17.04).</li> <li>The unit price is $250, and SSI expects an annual demand of 20,000 units.</li> <li>The operating and maintenance cost, including advertising expenses, would be $600,000 per year.</li> <li>An investment of $500,000 in working capital is required at the beginning of the project; the amount will be fully recovered when the project terminates.</li> <li>The firm’s marginal tax rate is 40%, and this rate will remain constant throughout the project period.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">(a) Determine the after-tax cash flows for this investment with external financing.<br /> (b) Is this project justified at an interest rate of 20%?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Discussion:</strong> As the amount of financing and flotation costs change, we need to recalculate the number of shares (or bonds) to be sold in each category. For a $5 million common-stock issue, the flotation cost increases to <span class="tex-text">\(8.1\%.^{4}\)</span> The number of shares to be sold to net $5 million is 5,000,000/(0.919)(28) = 194,311 shares (or $5,440,708). For a $5 million bond issue, the flotation cost is 3.2%. Therefore, to net $5 million, SSI has to sell 5,000,000/(0.968)(985) = 5,243.95 units of $1,000 par value. This implies that SSI is effectively borrowing $5,243,948, upon which figure the annual bond interest will be calculated. The annual bond interest payment is $5,243,948(0.12) = $629,274.</p>

<strong>Given:</strong> Financial data related to the SSI investment project.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Net cash flow with financing activities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>(a) After-tax cash flows.</strong> Table 15.2 summarizes the after-tax cash flows for the new venture. The following calculations and assumptions were used in developing the table.</p>
 <ul> <li>Revenue: $250 <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 20,000 = $5,000,000 per year.</li> <li>Costs of goods: $50.31 <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 20,000 = $1,006,200 per year.</li> <li>Bond interest: $5,243,948 <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 0.12 = $629,274 per year.</li> <li>Depreciation: Assuming that the building is placed in service in January, the first year’s depreciation percentage is 2.4573%. Therefore, the allowed depreciation amount is $3,000,000 <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> 0.024573 = $73,718. The percentages for the remaining years would be 2.5641% per year (or $76,923) and year five is back to $73,718 due to the mid-month convention. Equipment is depreciated according to a seven-year MACRS.</li> <li>Gains tax:</li> </ul> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="407"> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center" width="119"><strong>Property</strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="72"><strong>Salvage Value</strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="72"><strong>Book Value</strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="72"><strong>Gains (Losses)</strong></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="72"><strong>Gains Tax</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Land</td> <td>$1,500,000</td> <td>$1,000,000</td> <td>$500,000</td> <td>$200,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Building</td> <td>2,000,000</td> <td>2,621,795</td> <td>(621,795)</td> <td>(248,718)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Equipment</td> <td>2,500,000</td> <td>1,606,500</td> <td>893,500</td> <td>357,400</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>$308,682</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <ul> <li>Cash dividend: 194,311 shares <span class="tex-text">\(\times\)</span> $2 = $388,622.</li> <li>Common stock: When the project terminates and the bonds are retired, the debt ratio is no longer 0.5. If SSI wants to maintain the constant capital structure (0.5), SSI would have to repurchase the common stock in the amount of $5,440,708 at the prevailing market price. In developing Table 15.2, we assumed that this repurchase of common stock had taken place at the end of project year. In practice, a firm may or may not repurchase the common stock. As an alternative means of maintaining the desired capital structure, the firm may use this extra debt capacity, released to borrow for other projects.</li> <li>Bond: When the bonds mature at the end of year five, the total face value in the amount of $5,243,948 must be paid to the bondholders.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
<strong>(b) Measure of project worth.</strong> The NPW for this project is then</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(20%) = -$500,000 + $1,642,541(P/F, 20%, 1) + &#8230;<br /> = -$3,086,597(P/F, 20%, 5)<br /> = $2,707,529</p>
 <p class="blog">
The investment is not simple, and it is also a mixed investment. The RIC at MARR of 20% is 327%. Even though the project requires a significant amount of cash expenditure at the end of its life, it still appears to be a very profitable one.</p>
