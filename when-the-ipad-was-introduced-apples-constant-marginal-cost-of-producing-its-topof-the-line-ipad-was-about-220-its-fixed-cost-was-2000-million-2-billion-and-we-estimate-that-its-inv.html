                <p style="text-align: left">1. Derive the average cost function using the information about Apple’s marginal and fixed costs. Given that Apple’s marginal cost was constant, its average variable cost, AVC, equaled its marginal cost,$220. Its average fixed cost, AFC, was its fixed cost divided by the quantity produced, 2,000/Q. Thus, its average cost was AC = AVC + AFC = 220 + 2,000/Q.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Derive Apple’s marginal revenue function using the information about its demand function. Because the inverse demand function<br /> was p = 770 &#8211; 11Q, Apple’s revenue function was R = 770Q &#8211; 11Q2, so MR = dR/dQ = 770 &#8211; 22Q.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Derive Apple’s profit-maximizing price and quantity by equating the marginal revenue and marginal cost functions and solving. Apple maximized its profit where</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(MR = 770 &#8211; 22Q = 220 = MC.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving this equation for the profit- maximizing output, we find that Q = 25 million iPads. By substituting this quantity into the inverse demand equation, we determine that the profit-maximizing price was p = $495 per unit, as the figure shows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Calculate Apple’s profit using the profit-maximizing price and quantity and the average cost. At Q = 25, the firm’s average cost was<br /> AC = 220 + 2,000/25 = $300. The firm’s profit was π = (p &#8211; AC)Q = [495 &#8211; 300]25 = $4,875 million (= $4.875 billion). The figure shows that the profit is a rectangle with a height of (p &#8211; AC) = $195 and a length of Q = 25.</p>
