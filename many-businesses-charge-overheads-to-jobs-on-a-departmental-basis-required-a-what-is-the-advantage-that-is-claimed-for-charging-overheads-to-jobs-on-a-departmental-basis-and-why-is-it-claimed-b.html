(a) Charging overheads to jobs on a departmental basis means that overheads are collected ‘product’ cost centre (department) by ‘product’ cost centre. This involves picking up the overheads that are direct to each department and adding to them a share of overheads that are general to the business as a whole. The overheads of ‘service’ cost centres must then be apportioned to the product cost centres. At this point, all of the overheads for the whole business are divided between the ‘product’ cost centres, such that the sum of the ‘product’ cost centre overheads equals those for the whole business. Dealing with overheads departmentally is believed to provide more fair and useful information to decision makers, because different departments may have rather different overheads, and applying overheads departmentally can take account of that and reflect it in job costs. In theory, dealing with overheads on a departmental basis is more costly than on a business-wide basis. In practice, it possibly does not make too much difference to the cost of collecting the information. This is because, normally, businesses are divided into departments, and the costs are collected departmentally, as part of the normal routine for exercising control over the business.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) In order to make any difference to the job cost that will emerge as a result of dealing with overheads departmentally, as compared with a business-wide basis, the following both need to be the case:</p>
 <ul> <li>the overheads per unit of the basis of charging (for example direct labour hours) need to be different from one department to the next; and</li> <li>the proportion (but not the actual amounts) of total overheads that are charged to jobs must differ from one job to the next.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
Assume, for the sake of argument, that direct labour hours are used as the basis of charging overheads in all departments. Also assume that there are three departments,<br /> A, B and C. There will be no difference to the overheads charged to a job if the rate of overheads per direct labour hour is the same for all departments. Obviously, if the charging rate is the same in all departments, that same rate must also apply to the business taken as a whole. Also, even where overheads per direct labour hour differ significantly from one department to another – if all jobs spend, say, about 20 per cent of their time in Department A, 50 per cent in Department B and 30 per cent in Department C – it will not make any difference whether overheads are charged departmentally or overall.<br /> These conclusions are not in any way dependent on the basis of charging overheads or even that overheads are charged on the same basis in each department.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The statements above combine to mean that, probably in many cases in practice, departmentalising overheads is not providing information that is significantly different from that which would be provided by charging overheads to jobs on a business-wide basis.</p>
