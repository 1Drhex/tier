We first let A correspond to the event that a student receives an A grade and R correspond to the event that a student attends class regularly. From the preceding information, we then have the following probabilities:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(P(R) = 0.80, P(A | R) = 0.35, and P(A | R^c) = 0.05.\)</span> Figure 4.8 shows a probability tree that consists of nodes (junctions) and branches (lines) where the initial node <span class="tex-text">\(O\)</span> is called the origin. The branches emanating from <span class="tex-text">\(O\)</span> represent the possible outcomes that may occur at the first stage. Thus, at stage 1 we have events <span class="tex-text">\(R and R^c\)</span> originating from <span class="tex-text">\(O\)</span>. These events become the nodes at the second stage. The sum of the probabilities coming from any particular node is equal to one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>a.</strong> Using the complement rule, if we know that there is an 80% chance that a student attends class regularly, <span class="tex-text">\(P(R) = 0.80\)</span>, then the probability that a student does not attend class regularly is found as <span class="tex-text">\(P(R^c) = 1 . P(R) = 1 . 0.80 = 0.20.\)</span> In order to arrive at a subsequent stage, and deduce the corresponding probabilities, we use the information obtained from the previous stage. For instance, given that a student attends class regularly, there is a 35% chance that the student receives an A grade; that is,<span class="tex-text">\(P(A | R) = 0.35.\)</span> Given that a student regularly attends class, the likelihood of not receiving an A grade is 65% because <span class="tex-text">\(P(A^c | R) = 1 &#8211; P(A | R) = 0.65.\)</span> Similarly, given <span class="tex-text">\(P(A | R^c) = 0.05\)</span>, we compute <span class="tex-text">\(P(A^c | R^c) = 1 &#8211; P(A | Rc) = 1 &#8211; 0.05 = 0.95.\)</span> Any path through branches of the tree from the origin to a terminal node defines the intersection of the earlier two events. Thus, following the top branches, we arrive at the event <span class="tex-text">\(A \cap R\)</span>, meaning that a student attends class regularly and receives an A grade. The probability of this event is the product of the probabilities attached to the branches forming that path; here we are simply applying the multiplication rule. Now we are prepared to answer parts b and c.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>b.</strong> Multiplying the probabilities attached to the top branches, we obtain <span class="tex-text">\(P(A \cap R) = P(A | R)P(R) = 0.35 \times 0.80 = 0.28;\)</span> there is a 28% chance that a student attends class regularly and receives an A grade.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>c.</strong> In order to find the probability that a student does not attend class regularly and receives an A grade, we compute</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(A ∩ R^c) = P(A | R^c) P(R^c) = 0.05 × 0.20 = 0.01.\)</span> <p class="blog">
<strong>d.</strong> The probability that a student receives an A grade, P(A), is not explicitly given in Example 4.16. However, we can sum the relevant joint probabilities in parts b and c to obtain this probability:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P(A) = P(A\cap R) + P(A\cap R^c ) = 0.28+0.01 = 0.29.\)</span>
