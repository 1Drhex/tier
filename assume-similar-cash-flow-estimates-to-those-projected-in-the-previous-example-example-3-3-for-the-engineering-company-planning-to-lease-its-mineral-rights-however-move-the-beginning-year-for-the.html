Solution by Hand<br /> Figure 3-7 presents the cash flows with equivalent P and F values indicated in the correct years for the <span class="tex-text">\(P/A\)</span> , <span class="tex-text">\(P/F\)</span> , and <span class="tex-text">\( F/A \)</span> factors.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. First determine the present worth of the series in year 2. Then the total present worth <span class="tex-text">\(P_T \)</span> is the sum of three P values: the series present worth value moved back to <span class="tex-text">\( t = 0 \)</span> with the <span class="tex-text">\( P/F\)</span> factor, and the P values at <span class="tex-text">\( t = 0 \)</span> for the two single amounts in years 6 and 16.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P^{\prime }_{A} = 20 ,000(P/A,16\%,20)\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(P_T = P^{\prime }_{A} (P/F, 16\%,2) + 10,000(P/F,16\%,6) + 15,000(P/F,16\%, 16)\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(= 20,000(P/A, 16\%,20)(P/F,16\%,2) + 10,000(P/F,16\%,6) + 15,000(P/F,16\% ,16)\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(= \$93,625\)</span> [3.1]</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. To determine F in year 22 from the original cash flows (Figure 3-7), find F for the 20-year series and add the F values for the two single amounts. Be sure to carefully determine the n values for the single amounts: <span class="tex-text">\(n = 22 &#8211; 6 = 16\)</span> for the $10,000 amount and <span class="tex-text">\(n = 22 &#8211; 16 = 6\)</span> for the $15 ,000 amount.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F = 20,000(F/A, 16\%,20) + 10,000(F/P,l6\%,16) + 15,000(F/P, 16\%,6) \)</span> [3.2]<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(= \$2,451,626\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Multiply the present worth amount <span class="tex-text">\(P_T =\$93,625\)</span> from (1) above by the A/P factor for 22 years to determine an equivalent 22-year A series, referred to as <span class="tex-text">\( A _{1-22 }\)</span> here.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-22 } = P_T (A/P,16\%,22) = 93,625(0.16635) = \$15,575 \)</span> [3.3]</p>
 <p class="blog">
An alternate way to determine the 22-year series uses the F value from (2) above. In this case, the computation is <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-22 } = F(A/F,16\%,22) = \$15,575.\)</span> Note that in both methods, the equivalent total P or F value is determined first, then the A/P or A/F factor for 22 years is applied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. This and (5), which follows, are special cases that often occur in engineering economy studies. The equivalent A series is calculated for a number of years different from that covered by the original cash flows. This occurs when a defined study period or planning horizon is preset for the analysis. (More is mentioned about study periods later.)<br /> To determine the equivalent A series for years 1 through 10 only (call it <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-10 }\)</span> ) the <span class="tex-text">\( P_T\)</span> value must be used with the A/P factor for n = 10. This computation will transform the original cash flows in Figure 3- 7 into the equivalent series <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-10 }\)</span> in Figure 3-8a.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-10} = P_T (A/P,16\%,10) = 93,625(0.20690) = \$19,371 \)</span> [3.4]</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. For the equivalent 12-year series for years 11 through 22 (call it<span class="tex-text">\(A_{11-22 }\)</span>), the F value must be used with the A/F factor for 12 years. This transforms Figure 3-7 into the 12-year series <span class="tex-text">\(A_{11-22}\)</span> in Figure 3-8b.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A_{11-22} = F(A/F,16\%,12) = 2,451,626(0.03241) = \$79,457 \)</span> [3.5]</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice the huge difference of more than $60,000 in equivalent annual amounts that occurs when the present worth of $93,625 is allowed to compound at 16% per year for the first 10 years. This is another demonstration of the time value of money.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solution by Computer<br /> Figure 3-9 is a spreadsheet image with answers for all five questions. The $20,000 series and the two single amounts have been entered into separate columns, B and C. The zero cash flow values are all entered so that the functions will work correctly. This is an excellent example demonstrating the versatility of the NPV, FV, and PMT functions. In order to prepare for sensitivity analysis, the functions are developed using cell reference format or global variables, as indicated in the cell tags. This means that virtually any number- the interest rate, any cash flow estimate in the series or the single amounts, and the timing within the 22-year time frame-can be changed and the new answers will be immediately displayed. This is the general spreadsheet structure utilized for performing an engineering economy analysis with sensitivity analysis on the estimates.<br /> 1. Present worth values for the series and single amounts are determined in cells E6 and E10, respectively, using the NPV function. The sum of these in E14 is <span class="tex-text">\(P_T = \$93,622\)</span>, which corresponds to the value in Equation [3.1].</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. The FV function in cell E18 uses the P value in E14 (preceded by a minus sign) to determine F twenty-two years later. This is significantly easier than Equation [3.2],which determines the three separate F values and adds them to obtain F = $2,451,626. Of course, either method is correct.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. To find the 22-year A series of $15,574 starting in year 1, the PMT function in E21 references the P value in cell E14. This is effectively the same procedure used in Equation [3.3] to obtain <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-22 }\)</span>. For the spreadsheet enthusiast, it is possible to find the 22-year A series value in E21 directly by using the PMT function with embedded NPV functions. The cell reference format would be <span class="tex-text">\(PMT(D1,22,-\)</span>(NPV<span class="tex-text">\((D1,B6:B27)+B5 +\)</span> NPV<span class="tex-text">\((D1,C6:C27)+C5))\)</span>.<br /> 4. and 5. It is quite simple to determine an equivalent uniform series over any number of periods using a spreadsheet, provided the series starts one period after the P value is located or ends in the same period that the F value is located. These are both true for the series requested here-the first 10-year series can reference P in cell E14, and the last 12-year series can anchor on F in cell E18. The results in E24 and E27 are the same as <span class="tex-text">\(A_{1-10 }\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{11-22 }\)</span> in Equations [3.4] and [3.5], respectively.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Comment<br /> Remember that some round-off error will always be present when comparing hand and computer results. The spreadsheet functions carry more decimal places than the tables during calculations. Also, be very careful when constructing spreadsheet functions. It is easy to miss a value, such as the P or F in PMT and FV functions, or a minus sign between entries. Always check your function entries carefully before touching &lt;Enter&gt;.</p>
