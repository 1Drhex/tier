(a) (i) The cost of assets acquired to provide facilities for research and development (R&amp;D) should be capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives, and included as part of the R&amp;D expense. Where an asset is used in development activities, the depreciation can be included as development costs and capitalised. The new calibrating equipment purchased for the laboratory is an asset which will be used on various projects, not solely R&amp;D projects. Because the various projects on which it will be used cannot be identified, the machine should be classed as a tangible noncurrent asset. It should be depreciated in the same way as T’s existing machinery.<br /> (ii) The long-range radar project satisfies the criteria stated in IAS 38, which requires R&amp;D expenditure to be deferred to future periods. The project is clearly defined, and its related expenditure is separately identifiable. The outcome of the project has been assessed as technically feasible and commercially viable, and is expected to make a profit. The costs should therefore be included in the balance sheet as an intangible non-current asset, and amortised when commercial production commences.<br /> (iii) The outcome of the wide-angle microwave project is much less certain. The project may be commercially successful, but it is too early to be sure. IAS 38 does not allow expenditure of this kind to be deferred to future periods. The costs must be written off in the income statement as they are incurred. This is because certain expenditure can be regarded as part of the continuing operation required to maintain a entity’s business and competitive position. It is also in accordance with the fundamental accounting concept of prudence.<br /> (b) Given that there are no specific accounting standards governing the accounting treatment of the trade fair, T should turn to the IASB Framework. If the costs are carried forward they need to meet the definition of an asset set out in the Framework. An asset must have future economic benefit to the entity. Since there is no indication of any increase in future sales revenue the trade fair cost does not seem to have any future economic benefit. It should therefore be treated as an expense not an asset.<br /> Because the cost is significant, and not a normal part of selling and distribution, it should be disclosed separately in a note to the income statement.<br /> (c) Financial statements must be prepared in accordance with accounting standards. It is sometimes possible for an entity to adhere to the letter of the law while failing to comply with the spirit of the law. The most important requirement is that the accounts show a true and fair view. Thus, even if the directors of T have come up with a creative accounting scheme which does not appear to break any accounting rules or legislation, the chief accountant should explain to the directors that the financial statements must be adjusted to show a true and fair view of the entity’s profitability.<br /> The accountant could perhaps ask for the support of T’s external auditor, who could explain that any material distortion of the accounts would inevitably lead to a qualified audit report.</p>
