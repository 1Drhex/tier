            <p class="blog">Appy Daze Ltd has produced a smart phone application (app) that enables users to test their blood pressure by holding their ears:The company&#8217;s fixed costs,which include the development of the app, total £30,000. Users pay 50p to download the app, of which Appy Daze Ltd receives 35p after deducting the phone manufacturer&#8217;s commission. there are no variable costs other than the commission</p> <p class="blog">During 2013 it expects that potential maximum downloads could be 200,000.<br /> (a) Calculate by formula the number of downloads that must be made for the company to<br /> break even. (Hint: use the formula Fixed Costs divided by Contribution per download.)<br /> (b) Calculate by formula the company’s likely profit or loss if only 60,000 downloads<br /> are paid for. (Hint: use the formula Total contribution &#8211; Fixed costs)<br /> (c) Calculate by formula the number of downloads that would have to be made for<br /> Appy Daze Ltd to make a profit of £50,000. (Hint: use the formula ([Fixed Costs +<br /> £50,000]/Contribution per download.)<br /> (d) A local medical supplies company, Healthy Heart plc, has asked Appy Daze Ltd to<br /> create a variation of the blood pressure app to incorporate an advert for Healthy<br /> Heart. The extra cost to Appy Daze Ltd of creating the app would be £5,000, which<br /> would not be reimbursed by Healthy Heart. Users would pay only 40p to download<br /> this version of the app, and Appy Daze would receive 30p after commission from<br /> each download. Healthy Heart would pay Appy Daze Ltd 20p for every user of the<br /> modified app who clicks through to Healthy Heart’s website. It is estimated that<br /> 40,000 downloads of this app will be made, and half of this total will click through<br /> to Healthy Heart’s website. Advise Appy Daze Ltd (using appropriate formulae)<br /> whether they should accept the contract from Healthy Heart plc.<br /> (Hint: calculate the total extra contribution generated from this app and compare it to<br /> the additional fixed costs).<br /> (e) Show the information relating to the ‘original’ app (i.e. excluding the Healthy<br /> Heart contract) in the form of a break-even chart.</p>

Preliminary calculation of the contribution per download:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 148px" width="497"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="294"></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="64">p</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Price per download before commission</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Variable costs per download (50p &#8211; 35 p)</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Contribution per download</td> <td>35</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
(a) To break even, the total contribution must exactly equal fixed costs. Fixed costs are<br /> £30,000 and the contribution per download is 35p, therefore the break-even point<br /> is £30,000/35p = 85,714 downloads.<br /> (b) If there are only 60,000 downloads, total contribution = 60,000 × 35p = £21,000.<br /> Fixed costs are £30,000, therefore the loss will be £30,000 &#8211; £21,000 = £9,000.<br /> (c) To make a profit of £50,000, the total contribution (Profit + Fixed costs) would<br /> need to be £50,000 + £30,000 = £80,000. As the contribution per download is<br /> 35p, the number of downloads needed is £80,000/35p = 228,571. As the maximum<br /> forecast downloads is only 200,000, this target profit is not achievable.<br /> (d) The decision whether or not to accept the contract from Healthy Heart is based on<br /> whether it will make a positive contribution and an increased profit. The contribution<br /> per download for this app will be as follows:</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 152px" width="479"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="294"></td> <td style="text-align: center" width="64">p</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Price per download before commission</td> <td>40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Less Variable costs per download (40p -30p)</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Contribution per download</td> <td>30</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Expected downloads total 40,000, so the contribution would be 40,000 × 30p =<br /> £12,000. Additionally, the revenue generated from the click-through income would</p>
 <p class="blog">
be <span class="tex-text">\((\frac{1}{2}\times 40,000)\times 20p = 20,000\times 20p= £4,000 \)</span> . Total expected additional contribution<br /> therefore is £12,000 + £4,000 = £16,000. Compare this with the additional<br /> fixed costs of £5,000, and it can be seen that Appy Daze Ltd would generate a forecast<br /> additional profit of £16,000 &#8211; £5,000 = £11,000 if it accepted the contract.<br /> (e) Break-even chart</p>

Note: The margin of safety in Figure 12.7 indicates the number of units between the breakeven<br /> point (approximately 85,000 downloads) and the maximum potential downloads<br /> (200,000 downloads). This informs management how much leeway they have if costs<br /> rise and the break-even point starts to ‘travel’ to the right along the total cost line.</p>
