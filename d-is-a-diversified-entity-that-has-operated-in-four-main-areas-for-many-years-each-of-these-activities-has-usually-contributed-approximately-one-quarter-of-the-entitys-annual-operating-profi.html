            <p class="blog">D is a diversified entity that has operated in four main areas for many years. Each of these activities has usually contributed approximately one-quarter of the entity’s annual operating profit. During the year ended 31 December 20X3, the entity disposed of its glass-making division.<br /> The entity’s chief accountant has prepared the following summary of revenues and expenses:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="217"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="3" width="217">D – analysis of costs and revenues, year ended 31 December 20X3</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Glass-making</td> <td>Other divisions</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>$</td> <td>$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sales revenue</td> <td>150</td> <td>820</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Operating expenses</td> <td>98</td> <td>470</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Losses on disposal of non-current assets</td> <td>205</td> <td>61</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">The entity also incurred interest charges of $37,000 during the year, all of which relates to continuing activities. The income tax charge for the year has been estimated at $24,000,made up of a $50,000 charge on the continuing activities and a $26,000 refund for discontinued activities. A dividend of $30,000 was paid during the year.<br /> The entity made an issue of 100,000 $1 shares at a premium of 80¢ per share during the year. Shareholders’ funds at the beginning of the year were made up as follows:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="153"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89"></td> <td width="64">$000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Share capital</td> <td>250</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Share premium account</td> <td>150</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Revaluation reserve</td> <td>160</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retained earnings</td> <td>670</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>1,230</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">The balance on the revaluation reserve arose when the entity valued the land occupied by the properties used in its retail division. In view of recent developments, it has been decided that this reserve should be reduced to $90,000 to reflect the reduced value of the properties.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Explain how the analysis required by IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations assists in assessing a business’s future results and cash flows.<br /> (b) Prepare an outline income statement (showing the detail in notes to the income statement) for the year ended 31 December 20X3 for D in a form suitable for publication, complying with the requirements of IFRS 5.

(a) The information provided in financial statements, while historic, is often used by readers of accounts to evaluate future performance. Any additional information about what makes up profits and cash flows can help in the assessment of what is likely to be generated in future periods.<br /> IFRS 5 requires that the financial information be analysed between results from continuing operations and those from discontinued operations. Discontinued operations can be an entire part of the business operations being sold or terminated. It follows then that a discontinued operation will not generate results in future periods and so should not be included in the users’ assessment of future performance. The results of continuing operations are likely to recur in future periods and users can then focus on these results when evaluating what the entity is likely to generate in the future.<br /> The analysis of continuing operations and discontinued operations is required for financial performance, assets and liabilities and cash flows.<br /> (b) D – income statement for the year ended 31 December 20X3</p>
