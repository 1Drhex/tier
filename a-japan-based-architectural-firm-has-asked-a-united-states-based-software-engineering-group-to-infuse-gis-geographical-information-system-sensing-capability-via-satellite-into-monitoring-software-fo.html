            <p class="blog">A Japan-based architectural firm has asked a United States-based software engineering group to infuse GIS (geographical information system) sensing capability via satellite into monitoring software for high-rise structures in order to detect greater-than-expected horizontal movements. This software could be very beneficial as an advance warning of serious tremors in earthquake-prone areas in Japan and the United States. The inclusion of accurate GIS data is estimated to increase annual revenue over that for the CUITent software system by $200,000 for each of the next 2 years, and by $300,000 for each of years 3 and 4. The planning horizon is only 4 years due to the rapid advances made internationally in building-monitoring software. Develop spreadsheets to answer the questions below.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Determine the equivalent future value in year 4 of the increased cash flows, using an 8% per year rate of return. Obtain answers for both simple and compound interest.</p> <p class="blog">(b) Rework part (a) if the cash flow estimates in years 3 and 4 increase from $300,000 to $600,000.</p> <p class="blog">(c) The financial manager of the U.S. company wants to consider the effects of 4% per year inflation in the analysis of part (a). As mentioned in Section 1.4, inflation reduces the real rate of return. For the 8% rate of return, an inflation rate of 4% per year compounded each year reduces the return to 3.85% per year.</p>

Refer to Figure 1-12a to c for the solutions. All three spreadsheets contain the same information, but the cell values are altered as required by the question. (Actually, all the questions posed here can be answered on one spreadsheet by simply changing the numbers. Three spreadsheets are shown here for explanation purposes only.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Excel functions are constructed with reference to the cells, not the values themselves, so that sensitivity analysis can be perfOlmed without function changes. This approach treats the value in a cell as a global variable for the spreadsheet. For example, the 8% (simple or compound interest) rate in cell B4 will be referenced in all functions as B4, not 8%. Thus, a change in the rate requires only one alteration in the cell B4 entry, not in every spreadsheet relation and function where 8% is used. Key Excel relations are detailed in the cell tags.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) 8% simple interest. Refer to Figure 1-12a, columns C and D, for the answers. Simple interest earned each year (column C) incorporates Equation [1.5]</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Interest = (principal)(number of periods)(interest rate) [1.5]</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
one year at a time into the interest relation by using only the end-of-year (EOY) cash flow amounts ($200,000 or $300,000) to determine interest for the next year. This interest is added to the interest from all previous years. In $1000 units,</p>
 <p class="blog">
Year 2: C 13 = B 12*B4 = $200(0.08) = $16 (see the cell tag)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Year 3: C14 = CI3 + B13*B4 = $16 + 200(0.08) = $32</p>
 <p class="blog">
Year 4: CI5 = Cl4 + B14*B4 = $32 + 300(0.08) = $56 (see the cell tag)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Remember, an = sign must precede each relation in the spreadsheet. Cell C 16 contains the function SUM(Cl2:C15) to display the total simple interest of $104,000 over the 4 years. The future value is in DIS. It is F = $1, I 04,000 which includes the cumulative amount of all cash flows and all simple interest. In $1000 units, example functions are</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Year 2: DI3 = SUM(B13:C13) + DI2 = ($200 + 16) + 200 = $416<br /> Year 4: DIS = SUM(BI5:CI5) + 014 = ($300 + 56) + 748 = $1104</p>
 <p class="blog">
8% compound inrerest. See Figure 1-12a, columns E and F. The spreadsheet structure is the same, except that Equation [1.6]</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Interest = (principal + all accrued interest)(interest rate) [1.6]</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
is incorporated into the compound interest values in column E, thus adding interest on top of earned interest.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Interest at 80/0 is based on the accumulated cash flow at the end of the previous year. In $1000 units,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Year 2 interest: E13 = F12*B4 = $200(0.08) = $16</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Cumulative cash flow: F13 = B13 + E13 + F12 = $200 + 16 + 200 = $416</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Year 4 interest: E15 = F14*B4 = $749.28(0.08) = $59.942</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">(see the cell tag)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Cumulative cash flow: Fl5 = B15 + E15 + F14</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $300 + 59.942 + 749.280 = $1109.222</p>
 <p class="blog">
The equivalent future value is in cell FI5, where F = $1,109,222 is shown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash flows are equivalent to $1,104,000 at a simple 80/0 interest rate, and $1,109,222 at a compound 80/0 interest rate. Using a compound interest rate increases the F value by $5222.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that it is not possible to use the FV function in this case because the A values are not the same for all 4 years. We wilt learn how to use all the basic functions in more versatile ways in the next few chapters.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Refer to Figure 1-12b. In order to initialize the spreadsheet with the two increased cash flow estimates, replace the $300,000 values in B 14 and B I 5 with $600,000. All spreadsheet relations are identical, and the new interest and accumulated cash flow values are shown immediately. The equivalent fourth-year F values have increased for both the 80/0 simple and compound interest rates (D15 and F15, respectively).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) Figure 1-12c is identical to the spreadsheet in Figure 1-12a, except the cell B4 now contains the rate of 3.850/0 . The corresponding F value for compound interest in F15 has decreased to $1,051,247 from the $1,109,222 at 80/0. This represents an effect of inflation of $57,975 in only four years. It is no surprise that governments, corporations, engineers, and all individuals are concerned when inflation rises and the currency is worth less over time.</p>

<strong>Comment</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
When working with an Excel spreadsheet, it is possible to display all of the entries and functions on the screen by simultaneously touching the &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;&#8216; &gt; keys, which may be in the upper left of the keyboard on the key with &lt;~&gt;. Additionally, it may be necessary to widen some columns in order to display the entire function statement.</p>
