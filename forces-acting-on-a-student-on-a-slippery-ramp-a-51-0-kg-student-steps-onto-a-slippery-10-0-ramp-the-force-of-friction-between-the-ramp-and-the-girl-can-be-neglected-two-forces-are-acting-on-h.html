When dealing with two or more forces, it is often helpful to draw a detailed FBD, such as the one shown in Figure 2-9(b).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) To find the components of each vector, we have to find the angles that the vector forms with the coordinate axes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The angle between the force of gravity <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}_{g}\)</span> and the y-axis equals the angle of the ramp. (Make sure you can prove it.) The force of gravity vector, marked in green, forms the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle in Figure 2-9(b). In this triangle, the side adjacent to the 10.0° angle represents the y component of <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}_{g}\)</span>, and the side opposite to the 10.0° angle represents the x-component. Therefore, the components of the force of gravity are as follows, by Equation 2-1:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left\{\begin{array} { l } { F _ { g , x } = F _ { g } \operatorname { s i n } 1 0 ^ { \circ } } \\{ F _ { g , y } = &#8211; F _ { g } \operatorname { c o s } 1 0 ^ { \circ } }\end{array} \Rightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l}F_{g, x}=(500 N )(0.1736)=86.8 N \\F_{g, y}=-(500 N )(0.9848)=-493 N\end{array}\right.\right.\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\left\{\begin{array} { l } { v _ { x } = v \operatorname { c o s } \theta } \\{ v _ { y } = v \operatorname { s i n } \theta }\end{array} \Rightarrow \left\{\begin{array}{l}v=\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}} \\\tan \theta=\frac{v_{y}}{v_{x}}\end{array}\right.\right.\)</span> {2-1}</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The negative sign indicates that the y-component of the force of gravity is directed in the negative y-direction. In this case, it is convenient to measure the angle from the negative y-axis; however, we always compare the direction of the vector with the direction of the positive x- and y-axes to determine the signs of the x- and y-components, respectively.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The normal force, <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{N}\)</span>, is directed in the positive y-direction. Consequently, the angle between the normal force and the x-axis is 90.0°, and</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}N_{x}=N \cos 90^{\circ}=0 \\N_{y}=N \sin 90^{\circ}=493 N\end{array}\right.\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) From Figure 2-9(c) we can see that if the vectors are not drawn exactly to scale, or if their directions are slightly inaccurate, we will not be able to obtain a precise value of the resultant force from measuring it on the diagram. Therefore, we use the algebraic approach. Adding the x- and y-components of the gravitational and normal forces, we get</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\left\{\begin{array}{l}F_{R, x}=86.8 N +0=86.8 N \\F_{R, y}=-493 N +493 N =0\end{array}\right.\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resultant force has a non-zero x-component and a zero y-component. Therefore, it points along the x-axis in the positive x-direction down the ramp. Since the y-component is zero, the magnitude of the resultant force, <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}_{ R }\)</span>, is equal to the x-component, <span class="tex-text">\(F_{ R }=86.8 N\)</span>. Notice that since the resultant force represented the sum of all the forces acting on the girl, the resultant force in this case equals the net force: <span class="tex-text">\(\vec{F}_{ R } \equiv \vec{F}_{\text {net }}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
We know from our everyday experience that if we stand on a slippery ramp, we will slide down. Thus, it makes sense that the net force is non-zero <span class="tex-text">\(\left(F_{\text {net }}=86.8 N \right)\)</span> and is directed down the ramp. We can also see that the net force is much smaller than either the gravitational force or the normal force. This is because the two forces act in nearly opposite directions. As we will discuss later in the chapters on Newton’s laws, an unbalanced (non-zero) net force means that the object’s velocity is changing. Therefore, we should expect the student to slide down the ramp with increasing speed. In this example of a slippery ramp, we ignored the force of friction between the student and the ramp. If present, a friction force would have been directed up the ramp—in the direction opposite to the girl’s motion. Notice that choosing an x-axis along the ramp simplified the calculations because the net force is directed down the ramp. It is often convenient to have one of the axes directed along the net force.</p>
