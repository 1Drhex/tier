All of the NAND gate outputs are correct for the levels present at their inputs. The XOR gate, however, should e producing a LOW at output pin 3 because both of its inputs are at the same LOW level. It appears that Z1-3 is stuck HIGH, even though its inputs should produce a LOW. There are several possible causes for this:<br /> 1. An internal component failure in Z1 that prevents its output from going LOW<br /> 2. An external short to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> from any point along the conductors connected to node <em>X</em> (shaded in the diagram of the figure)<br /> 3. Pin 3 of Z1 internally shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span><br /> 4. Pin 5 of Z2 internally shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span><br /> 5. Pin 13 of Z2 internally shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span><br /> All of these possibilities except for the first one will short node <em>X</em> (and every<br /> IC pin connected to it) directly to<span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span><br /> The following procedure can be used to isolate the fault. This procedure is not the only approach that can be used and, as we stated earlier, the actual troubleshooting procedure that a technician uses is very dependent on what test equipment is available.<br /> 1. Check the <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> and ground levels at the appropriate pins of Z1. Although it is unlikely that the absence of either of these might cause Z1-3 to stay HIGH, it is a good idea to make this check on any IC that is producing an incorrect output.<br /> 2. Turn off power to the circuit and use an ohmmeter to check for a short (resistance less than 1 Ω) between node X and any point connected to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> (such as Z1-14 or Z2-14). If no short is indicated, the last four possibilities in our list can be eliminated. This means that it is very likely that Z1 has an internal failure and should be replaced.<br /> 3. If step 2 shows that there is a short from node X to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span>, perform a thorough visual examination of the circuit board and look for solder bridges, unetched copper slivers, uninsulated wires touching each other, and any other possible cause of an external short to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span>. A likely spot for a solder bridge would be between adjacent pins 13 and 14 of Z2. Pin 14 is connected to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> and pin 13 to node X. If an external short is found, remove it and perform an ohmmeter check to verify that node X is no longer shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span>.<br /> 4. If step 3 does not reveal an external short, the three possibilities that remain are internal shorts to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> at Z1-3, Z2-13, or Z2-5. One of these is shorting node X to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span>.<br /> To determine which of these IC pins is the culprit, we should disconnect each of them from node X one at a time and recheck for a short to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> after each disconnection. When the pin that is internally shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span> is disconnected, node <em>X</em> will no longer be shorted to <span class="tex-text">\(V_{CC}\)</span>.<br /> The process of disconnecting each suspected pin from node <em>X</em> can be easy or difficult depending on how the circuit is constructed. If the ICs are in sockets, all you need to do is to pull the IC from its socket, bend out the suspected pin, and reinsert the IC into its socket. If the ICs are soldered into a printed circuit board, you will have to cut the trace that is connected to the pin and repair the cut trace when you are finished.</p>
