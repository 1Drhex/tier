Generally, although not always, the support reactions must be calculated first. So, taking moments about D for the truss in Fig. 4.15 we obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(R_A\times 2-2\times 1.5-1\times 1-3\times 0.5=0 \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
which gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(R_A=2.75 kN\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Then, resolving vertically</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(R_{ D }+R_{ A }-2-1-3=0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
so that</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(R_{ D }=3.25 kN\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that there will be no horizontal reaction at A (D is a roller support) since no horizontal loads are applied.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The next step is to assign directions to the forces acting on each joint. In one approach the truss is examined to determine whether the force in a member is tensile or compressive. For some members this is straightforward. For example, in Fig. 4.15, the vertical reaction at A, <span class="tex-text">\(R_{ A }\)</span>, can only be equilibrated by the vertical component of the force in AB which must therefore act downwards, indicating that the member is in compression (a compressive force in a member will push towards a joint whereas a tensile force will pull away from a joint). In some cases, where several members meet at a joint, the nature of the force in a particular member is difficult, if not impossible, to determine by inspection. Then a direction must be assumed which, if incorrect, will result in a negative value for the member force. It follows that, in the same truss, both positive and negative values may be obtained for tensile forces and also for compressive forces, a situation leading to possible confusion. Therefore, if every member in a truss is initially assumed to be in tension, negative values will always indicate compression and the solution will then agree with the sign convention adopted in Section 3.2.<br /> We now assign tensile forces to the members of the truss in Fig. 4.15 using arrows to indicate the action of the force in the member on the joint; then all arrows are shown to pull away from the adjacent joint. The analysis, as we have seen, is based on a consideration of the equilibrium of each pin or hinge under the action of all the forces at the joint. Thus for each pin or hinge we can write down two equations of equilibrium. It follows that a solution can only be obtained if there are no more than two unknown forces acting at the joint. In Fig. 4.15, therefore, we can only begin the analysis at the joints A or D, since at each of the joints B and C there are three unknown forces while at E there are four.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider joint A. The forces acting on the pin at A are shown in the free body diagram in Fig. 4.16. <span class="tex-text">\(F_{ AB }\)</span> may be determined directly by resolving forces vertically.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Hence</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ AB } \sin 60^{\circ}+2.75 \equiv 0\)</span> (i)</p>
 <p class="blog">
so that</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ AB }=-3.18 kN\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
the negative sign indicating that AB is in compression as expected. Referring again to Fig. 4.16 and resolving forces horizontally</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ AE }+F_{ AB } \cos 60^{\circ}=0\)</span> (ii)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the negative value of <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ AB }\)</span> in Eq. (ii) we obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( F_{ AE }-3.18 \cos 60^{\circ}=0\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
which gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ AE }=+1.59 kN\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
the positive sign indicating that <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ AB }\)</span> is a tensile force.<br /> Note that it is simpler to retain the assumed tensile direction of a force in the equations of equilibrium and then insert the positive or negative value rather than change the initial assumed direction.<br /> We now inspect the truss to determine the next joint at which there are no more than two unknown forces. At joint E there remain three unknowns since only <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ EA }\left(=F_{ AE }\right) \)</span> has yet been determined. At joint B there are now two unknowns since <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BA }\left(=F_{ AB }\right)\)</span> has been determined; we can therefore proceed to joint B. The forces acting at B are shown in Fig. 4.17. Since <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BA}\)</span> is now known we can resolve forces vertically and therefore obtain <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BE }\)</span> directly. Thus</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ BE } \cos 30^{\circ}+F_{ BA } \cos 30^{\circ}+2=0\)</span> (iii)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the negative value of <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BA}\)</span> in Eq. (iii) gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BE }=+0.87 kN \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
which is positive and therefore tensile.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Resolving forces horizontally at the joint B we have</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ BC }+F_{ BE } \cos 60^{\circ}-F_{ BA } \cos 60^{\circ}=0\)</span> (iv)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the positive value of <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BE }\)</span> and the negative value of <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ BA }\)</span> in Eq. (iv) gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(F_{ BC }=-2.03 kN\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
the negative sign indicating that the member BC is in compression.<br /> We have now calculated four of the seven unknown member forces. There are in fact just two unknown forces at each of the remaining joints C, D and E so that, theoretically, it is immaterial which joint we consider next. From a solution viewpoint there are three forces at D, four at C and five at E so that the arithmetic will be slightly simpler if we next consider D to obtain <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ DC } \text { and } F_{ DE } \)</span> and then C to obtain <span class="tex-text">\( F_{ CE } \cdot At C , F_{ CE } \)</span> could be determined by resolving forces in the direction CE rather than horizontally or vertically. Carrying out this procedure gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}&amp;F_{ DC }=-3.75 kN \text { (compression) } \\&amp;F_{ DE }=+1.88 kN \text { (tension) } \\&amp;F_{ CE }=+0.29 kN \text { (tension) }\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The reader should verify these values using the method suggested above.<br /> It may be noted that in this example we could write down 10 equations of equilibrium, two for each of the five joints, and yet there are only seven unknown member forces. The apparently extra three equations result from the use of overall equilibrium to calculate the support reactions. An alternative approach would therefore be to write down the 10 equilibrium equations which would include the three unknown support reactions (there would be a horizontal reaction at A if horizontal as well as vertical loads were applied) and solve the resulting 10 equations simultaneously. Overall equilibrium could then be examined to check the accuracy of the solution. Generally, however, the method adopted above produces a quicker solution.</p>
