            <p class="blog">calculating the lotto payments on $2 Million<br /> Forty-three states run lotteries, and most of those lotteries are similar: You must select 6 out of 44 numbers correctly in order to win the jackpot. If you come close, there are some significantly lesser prizes, which we ignore for now. For each million dollars in the lottery jackpot, you receive $50,000 per year for 20 years, and your chance of winning is 1 in 7.1 million. A recent advertisement for a particular state lottery went as follows: “Okay, you got two kinds of people. You’ve got the kind who play Lotto all the time, and the kind who play Lotto some of the time. You know, like only on a Saturday when they stop in at the store on the corner for some peanut butter cups and diet soda and the jackpot happens to be really big. I mean, my friend Ned? He’s like ‘Hey, it’s only $2 million this week.’ Well, hellloooo, anybody home? I mean, I don’t know about you, but I wouldn’t mind having a measly 2 mill coming my way.…”<br /> What is the present value of these payments?</p>

step 1: Formulate a solution strategy<br /> The answer to this question depends on what assumption you make about the time value of money. In this case, let’s assume that your required rate of return on an investment with this level of risk is 10 percent. Keeping in mind that the Lotto is an annuity due—that is, on a $2 million lottery win you would get $100,000 immediately and $100,000 at the end of each of the next 19 years. Thus, the present value of this 20-year annuity due discounted back to present at 10 percent becomes:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(P V(\text { annuity due })=P M T\left[\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right](1+r)\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
step 2: crunch the numbers<br /> Solving this question is a two-step process. In step 1, you treat the jackpot as if it were an ordinary annuity and find the present value. Then multiply the present value times (1 + r), in this case times 1.10.<br /> Substituting into equation (5-6), we compute the present value as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(P V(\text { annuity due })=P M T\left[\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right](1+r)\)</span> (5-6)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}P V &amp;=\$ 100,000\left[\frac{1-(1+0.10)^{-20}}{0.10}\right](1+0.10) \\&amp;=\$ 100,000(8.51356)(1.10) \\&amp;=\$ 936,492\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
step 3: analyze Your results<br /> Thus, the present value of the $2 million Lotto jackpot is less than $1 million if 10 percent is the discount rate. Moreover, because the chance of winning is only 1 in 7.1 million, the expected value of each dollar “invested” in the lottery is only (1 /7 .1 million) * ($ 9 3 6 ,4 9 2 ) = 1 3 .1 9 <em>c</em>. That is, for every dollar you spend on the lottery you should expect to get, on average, about 13 cents back—not a particularly good deal. Although this ignores the minor payments for coming close, it also ignores taxes. In this case, it looks like “my friend Ned” is doing the right thing by staying clear of the lottery. Obviously, the main value of the lottery is entertainment. Unfortunately, without an understanding of the time value of money, it can sound like a good investment.</p>
