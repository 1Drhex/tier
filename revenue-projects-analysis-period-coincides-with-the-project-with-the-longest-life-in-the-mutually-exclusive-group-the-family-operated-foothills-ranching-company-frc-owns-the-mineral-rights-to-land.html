            <p class="blog"><strong>Revenue Projects: Analysis Period Coincides with the Project with the Longest Life in the Mutually Exclusive Group</strong></p> <p class="blog">The family-operated Foothills Ranching Company (FRC) owns the mineral rights to land used for growing grain and grazing cattle. Recently, oil was discovered on this property. The family has decided to extract the oil, sell the land, and retire. The company can lease the necessary equipment and extract and sell the oil itself, or it can lease the land to an oil-drilling company.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>• Drill option.</strong> If the company chooses to drill, it will require $300,000 leasing expenses up front, but the net annual cash flow after taxes from drilling operations will be $600,000 at the end of each year for the next five years. The company can sell the land for a net cash flow of $1,000,000 in five years, when the oil is depleted.<br /> <strong>• Lease option.</strong> If the company chooses to lease, the drilling company can extract all the oil in only three years, and FRC can sell the land for a net cash flow of $800,000 at that time. (The difference in resale value of the land is due to the increasing rate of land appreciation anticipated for this property.) The net cash flow from the lease payments to FRC will be $630,000 at the beginning of each of the next three years.</p> <p class="blog">All benefits and costs associated with the two alternatives are shown in Figure 5.17. Which option should the firm select at i = 15%?</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/06/fegure-5-17-768x736.jpg"></div>

<strong>Given:</strong> Cash flows shown in Figure 5.17 and i = 15% per year.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> NPW of each alternative and which alternative to select.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As illustrated in Figure 5.17, after depletion of the oil, the project will terminate. The present worth of each of the two options is as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(BW\left(15\%\right) _{Drill}\)</span> = -$300,000 + $600,000(P/A, 15%, 4)<br /> + $1,600,000(P/F, 15%, 5)<br /> = $2,208,470</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(BW\left(15\%\right) _{Lease}\)</span> = $630,000 + $630,000(P/A, 15%, 2)<br /> + $800,000(P/F, 15%, 3)<br /> = $2,180,210</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that these are revenue projects; therefore, the drill option appears to be the marginally better option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> The relatively small difference between the two NPW amounts ($28,260) suggests that the actual decision between drilling and leasing might be based on noneconomic issues. Even if the drilling option is slightly better, the company might prefer to forgo the small amount of additional income and select the lease option, rather than undertake an entirely new business venture and do its own drilling. A variable that might also have a critical effect on this decision is the sales value of the land in each alternative. The value of land is often difficult to forecast over any long period, and the firm may feel some uncertainty about the accuracy of its guesses. In Chapter 12, we will discuss sensitivity analysis, a method by which we can factor uncertainty about the accuracy of project cash flows into our analysis.</p>
