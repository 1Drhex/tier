            <p class="blog">Peter, who was standing by a racetrack, calculated that as one of the cars, in accelerating from rest to a speed of <span class="tex-text">\( 100 km \ h^{-1} \)</span> , used up <span class="tex-text">\( x \)</span> litres of fuel, it could increase its speed to <span class="tex-text">\( 200 km \ h^{-1} \)</span> , by using a further <span class="tex-text">\( 3x \)</span> litres of fuel. Peter, who bas learned in physics that kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed, assumed that the energy content of the fuel was mainly converted into kinetic energy. i.e. he neglected air resistance and other types of friction.</p> <p class="blog">A railway runs by the racetrack. Paul, who also knows some physics, saw the start of the race from the window of a train travelling at a speed of <span class="tex-text">\( 100 km \ h^{-1} \)</span> in the opposite direction to that of the car. He reasoned as follows: since the car&#8217;s speed increased from <span class="tex-text">\( 100 \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( 200 km \ h^{-1} \)</span> during the first stage, when the car accelerates from <span class="tex-text">\( 200 \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( 300 km \ h^{- 1} \)</span> in the second stage, it will need <span class="tex-text">\( (300^2 - 200^2)/(200^2 - 100^2) x = (5/3)x \)</span> litres of fuel. Who is right, Peter or Paul?</p>

<em>Solution 1</em>. Whilst accelerating, a car &#8216;pushes&#8217; the Earth back a little and changes its rotational angular velocity. This very small effect has to be considered in order to resolve the paradox.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the sake of simplicity, consider the car, of mass <span class="tex-text">\( m \)</span> , to be travelling on a body of mass <span class="tex-text">\( M (M \gg m) \)</span> that can move freely in the direction of the motion of the car. In the actual situation, the Earth can rotate freely under the car. A stationary observer would say that if the car accelerates to some speed <span class="tex-text">\( v_o \)</span> and then subsequently to <span class="tex-text">\( 2v_o \)</span> , the body of mass <span class="tex-text">\( M \)</span> reaches a speed <span class="tex-text">\( u_1 = -mv_o/ M \)</span> and then <span class="tex-text">\( u_2 = -2mv_o/ M \)</span>, whilst its kinetic energy increases from an initial zero to <span class="tex-text">\( Mu^2_1/2 \)</span> and then to <span class="tex-text">\( Mu^2_2/2 \)</span>. Since <span class="tex-text">\( M \gg m \)</span>, the kinetic energy of the body of larger mass and the change in its energy can be neglected. Thus the ratio of the fuel consumption values has to be <span class="tex-text">\(1 : 3 \)</span>.<br /> The situation is different for the observer moving with speed <span class="tex-text">\( v_0\)</span> . He can see the speed of the car increasing from <span class="tex-text">\( v_o \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( 2v_o \)</span> and then to <span class="tex-text">\( 3v_o \)</span>, while, in accordance with the law of conservation of momentum, the speed of the other body changes from the initial <span class="tex-text">\( -v_o \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\(( 1 &#8211; m/ M)v_o \)</span> and then to <span class="tex-text">\( (1 -2m/ M)v_o \)</span>. The changes in the kinetic energy of the whole system (car plus Earth) are, therefore, firstly</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{2} m \left[(2v_0)^2-v_0^2\right] +\frac{1}{2} M\left(1-\frac{m}{M} \right) ^2 v_0^2-\frac{1}{2}Mv_0^2\approx \frac{1}{2} mv_0^2, \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
and, then, secondly</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{2} m \left[(3v_0)^2-(2v_0)^2\right] +\frac{1}{2} M\left(1-\frac{2m}{M} \right) ^2 v_0^2-\frac{1}{2}M\left(1-\frac{m}{M} \right)^2 v_0^2 \approx \frac{3}{2} mv_0^2. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
It can be seen that the energy (fuel consumption) ratio is <span class="tex-text">\( 1 : 3 \)</span> for both observers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Solution 2</em>. Friction pushes the ground backwards, i.e. it accelerates the car forward through its wheels. In the Earth&#8217;s frame of reference (Peter&#8217;s frame), work is done only on the car and not on the ground. On the other hand, in the train&#8217;s frame of reference (Paul&#8217;s frame), static friction acting on the ground also does work. Viewed from this frame, the ratio of work done on the car in the two stages is <span class="tex-text">\( 3 : 5 \)</span>, since the displacements of the car in time <span class="tex-text">\(t \)</span> are <span class="tex-text">\( 3v_ot/2 \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( 5v_ot/2 \)</span> , respectively. The work done on the ground is <span class="tex-text">\( -2 \)</span> units, as the displacement of the ground is <span class="tex-text">\( v_0t \)</span> . The total work done is thus <span class="tex-text">\( 3 &#8211; 2 = 1 \)</span> unit in the first stage of acceleration and <span class="tex-text">\( 5 &#8211; 2 = 3 \)</span> units in the second; their ratio, when viewed from the train, is therefore again <span class="tex-text">\( 1 : 3. \)</span></p>
