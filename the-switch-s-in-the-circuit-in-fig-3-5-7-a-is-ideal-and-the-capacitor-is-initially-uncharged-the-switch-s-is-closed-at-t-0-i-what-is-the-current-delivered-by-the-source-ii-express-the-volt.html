(i) The voltage across the capacitor has to change instantaneously in this circuit since <span class="tex-text">\(KVL\)</span> has to be obeyed at <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 ^{+}\)</span> . But instantaneous change in capacitor voltage will require an impulse current with an area content equal to the change in charge required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The change in stored charge required here is <span class="tex-text">\(100V × 1000 \mu F = 100mC\)</span>. Therefore, the current that flows in the circuit will be <span class="tex-text">\(0.1d (t).\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
(ii) The voltage across capacitor was zero till <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0^{-}\)</span>. It will be <span class="tex-text">\(100V\)</span> at and after <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0 ^{+} \)</span>. It is discontinuous at <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(v_{C}=\left\{\begin{matrix} 0 for t=0^{-}\\ undefined t=0\\ 100 for t \geq 0^{+} \end{matrix}\right.\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will be tempted to write this as <span class="tex-text">\(v_{C}(t) = 100 u(t)\)</span> where <span class="tex-text">\(u(t)\)</span> is the unit step function. But we do not know the capacitor voltage before <span class="tex-text">\(t = 0^{-}\)</span> So we can not express it that way.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(iii) Energy delivered by the source = Voltage × Charge transported across the voltage <span class="tex-text">\(= 100V × 0.1C = 10 J\)</span>. It can also be calculated as the area under the power waveform. The power delivered as a function of time is <span class="tex-text">\(100 × 0.1 \delta (t) = 10 \delta (t)\)</span>. Area under this waveform is <span class="tex-text">\(10 J\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(iv) Energy stored in the capacitor <span class="tex-text">\(= 0.5 × 0.001F × (100V)^{2} = 5 J\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(v) Energy delivered by the source and energy stored in the capacitor are not equal. The source delivered <span class="tex-text">\(5J\)</span> extra. This is a circuit in which the ‘capacitance’ model for a physical capacitor is not adequate. A physical capacitor is a physical device that is represented by the mathematical model of ‘capacitance’. This model is only a first level model that ignores the second level details of the physical device. Any electrical element will have all the three effects – resistance, capacitance and inductance – involved in it. Therefore, a capacitor has resistance and inductance associated with it. The resistance of metal foil used in the capacitor and the resistance of connecting leads contribute a series resistor to the model of capacitor. Leakage of current through the imperfect insulator used as the dielectric in the capacitor contributes a shunt resistor in the second level model for a capacitor. And the magnetic flux produced within the capacitor when current flows in its leads and foil contribute an inductance too. Thus a more accurate model for a physical capacitor is as shown in Fig. 3.5-7 (b). <span class="tex-text">\(R_{se}\)</span> is usually in <span class="tex-text">\(m \Omega\)</span> range, <span class="tex-text">\(R_{sh}\)</span> is usually in <span class="tex-text">\(k \Omega – M \Omega\)</span> range and <span class="tex-text">\(L_{se}\)</span> is in <span class="tex-text">\(nH – \mu H\)</span> range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We will see in a later chapter that this more detailed model will predict transient currents and voltages which oscillate at a high frequency when a <span class="tex-text">\(DC\)</span> voltage is suddenly switched on to an uncharged capacitor. The two resistors that are invariably present in any physical capacitor will take care of the extra energy delivered by the voltage source – they dissipate it.</p>
