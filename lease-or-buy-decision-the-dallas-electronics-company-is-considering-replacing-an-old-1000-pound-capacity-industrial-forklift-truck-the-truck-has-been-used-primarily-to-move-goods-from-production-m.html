            <p class="blog"><strong>Lease-or-Buy Decision</strong></p> <p class="blog">The Dallas Electronics Company is considering replacing an old, 1,000-pound-capacity industrial forklift truck. The truck has been used primarily to move goods from production machines into storage. The company is working nearly at capacity and is operating on a two-shift basis six days per week. Dallas management is considering owning or leasing the new truck. The plant engineer has compiled the following data for management.</p> <ul> <li>The initial cost of a gas-powered truck is $20,000. The new truck would use about 8 gallons of gasoline (in a single shift of 8 hours per day) at a cost of $3.35 per gallon. If the truck is operated 16 hours per day, its expected life will be four years, and an engine overhaul at a cost of $1,500 will be required at the end of two years.</li> <li>The Austin Industrial Truck Company has been servicing the old forklift truck, and Dallas would buy the new truck through Austin, which offers a service agreement to users of its trucks. The agreement costs $120 per month and provides for a monthly visit by an experienced service representative to lubricate and tune the truck. Insurance and property taxes for the truck are $650 per year.</li> <li>The truck is classified as five-year property under MACRS and could be depreciated accordingly. Dallas can take advantage of the Section 179 tax deduction. In that case, the full purchase amount of $20,000 can be deducted from its gross income. Dallas is in the 40% marginal tax bracket; the estimated resale value of the truck at the end of four years will be 15% of the original cost.</li> <li>Austin also has offered to lease a truck to Dallas. Austin will maintain the equipment and will guarantee to keep the truck in serviceable condition at all times. In the event of a major breakdown, Austin will provide a replacement truck at its expense. The cost of the operating lease plan is $850 per month. The contract term is three years at a minimum, with the option to cancel on 30 daysâ€™ notice thereafter.</li> <li>On the basis of recent experience, the company expects that funds committed to new investments should earn at least a 12% rate of return after taxes.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">(a) Determine the cost of owning the truck.<br /> (b) Determine the cost of leasing the truck.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Discussion:</strong> We may calculate the fuel costs for two-shift operation as</p> <p style="text-align: center">(8 gallons/shift)(2 shifts/day)($3.35/gallon) = $53.60 per day</p> <p class="blog">The truck will operate 300 days per year, so the annual fuel cost will be $16,080. However, both alternatives require the company to supply its own fuel, so the fuel cost is not relevant to our decision making. Revenue streams would be the same as fuel costs. Therefore, we may drop these common items from our calculations.</p>

<strong>Given:</strong> Preceding cost information, MARR = 12%, and marginal tax rate = 40%.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> (a) and (b) Incremental cost of owning versus leasing the truck, (c) Section 179 deduction versus capitalization of the asset</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>(a) Cost of owning the truck.</strong> To compare the incremental cost of ownership with the incremental cost of leasing, we make the following additional estimates and assumptions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 1.</strong> The preventive-maintenance contract, which costs $120 per month (or $1,440 per year), will be adopted. With annual insurance and taxes of $650, the equivalent present worth of the after-tax O&amp;M is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{1}\)</span> = ($1,440 + $650)(1 &#8211; 0.40)(P/A, 12%, 4) = $3,809</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 2.</strong> The engine overhaul is not expected to increase either the salvage value or the service life of the truck. Therefore, the overhaul cost ($1,500) will be expensed all at once rather than capitalized. The equivalent present worth of this after-tax overhaul expense is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{2}\)</span> = $1,500(1 &#8211; 0.40)(P/F, 12%, 2) = $717</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 3.</strong> If Dallas decided to purchase the truck through debt financing, the first step in determining financing costs would be to compute the annual installments of the debt repayment schedule. Assuming that the entire investment of $20,000 is financed at a 10% interest rate, the annual payment would be</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">A = $20,000(A/P, 10%, 4) = $6,309</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the interest and principal payment each year is calculated as</p>

 <p class="blog">

 <p style="text-align: center">= $2,508</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 4.</strong> With the five-year MACRS depreciation schedule, the tax shield (savings) due to depreciation expenses can be calculated as</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="361"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="72"><strong>n</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong><span class="tex-text">\(D_{n}\)</span></strong></td> <td width="217"><strong>Tax Savings (<span class="tex-text">\(t_{m} D_{n} \)</span>)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>$4,000</td> <td>$4,000(0.40) = $1,600</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>6,400</td> <td>6,400(0.40) = 2,560</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>3,840</td> <td>3,840(0.40) = 1,536</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>1,152*</td> <td>1,152(0.40) = 461</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3">*Half-year convention.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Therefore, the equivalent present worth of the depreciation tax savings (credit) is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{5}\)</span> = $1,600(P/F, 12%, 1) + $2,560(P/F, 12%, 2)<br /> + $1,536(P/F, 12%, 3) + $461(P/F, 12%, 4)<br /> = $4,856</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 5.</strong> With the estimated salvage value of 15% of the initial investment ($3,000) and with the five-year MACRS depreciation schedule given (total amount of depreciation = $15,392), we compute the net proceeds from the sale of the truck at the end of four years as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Book value = $20,000 &#8211; $15,392 = $4,608<br /> Gains (losses) = $3,000 &#8211; $4,608 = ($1,608)<br /> Tax savings = 0.40($1,608) = $643<br /> Net proceeds from sale = $3,000 + $643 = $3,643</p>
 <p class="blog">
The present equivalent amount of the net salvage value is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{6}\)</span> = $3,643(P/F, 12%, 4) = $2,315</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 6.</strong> Therefore, the net incremental cost of owning the truck through 100% debt financing is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(PW\left(12\%\right) _{Buy} = P_{1} + P_{2} +P_{3} +P_{4} &#8211; P_{5} &#8211; P_{6}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $3,809 + $717 + $14,983 + $2,508 &#8211; $4,856 &#8211; $2,315<br /> = $14,846</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>(b) Cost of leasing the truck.</strong> How does the cost of acquiring a forklift truck under the lease compare with the cost of owning the truck?</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 1.</strong> The lease payment is also a tax-deductible expense; however, the net cost of leasing has to be computed explicitly on an after-tax basis. The calculation of the annual incremental leasing costs is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">Annual lease payments (12 months) = $10,200<br /> Less 40% taxes = 4,080<br /> Annual net costs after taxes = $6,120</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 2.</strong> The total net present equivalent incremental cost of leasing is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(PW\left(12\%\right) _{Lease}\)</span> = $6,120(P/A, 12%, 4)<br /> = $18,589</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 3.</strong> Here, we have assumed that the lease payments occur at the end of the period; however, many leasing contracts require the payments to be made at the beginning of each period. In the latter situation, we can easily modify the present-worth expression of the lease expense to reflect this cash-flow timing:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(PW\left(12\%\right) _{Lease}\)</span> = $6,120 + $6,120(P/A, 12%, 3) = $20,819</p>
 <p class="blog">
Purchasing the truck through debt financing would save Dallas either $3,743 or $5,973 in NPW, depending on the lease payment term. Table 10.11 illustrates an alternate way of conducting a buy-versus-lease decision in tabular form using Excel.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> We may wonder here if Dallas should take the Section 179 deduction instead of capitalizing the asset. We can easily answer this question. We already know the cost of owning the truck through capitalizing the purchase cost, which is $14,846. If we go with the Section 179 deduction, there will be no tax shield related to depreciation, and the entire salvage value is subject to taxable gains. With these changes, the cost of owning the truck with the Section 179 deduction is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{5}\)</span> = $20,000(1 &#8211; 0.40)(P/F, 12%, 1)<br /> = $7,143</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(P_{6}\)</span> = $3,000(1 &#8211; 0.40)(P/F, 12%, 4) = $1,144</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(PW\left(12\%\right) _{Buy with Section 179}\)</span> = $3,809 + $717 + $14,983 + $2,508 &#8211; $7,143<br /> &#8211; $1,144<br /> = $13,730</p>
 <p class="blog">
Clearly, taking the 179 deduction instead of capitalizing the asset will make buying even more economical. You should not conclude, however, that leasing is always more expensive than owning. In many cases, analysis favors a lease option. The interest rate, salvage value, lease payment schedule, and debt financing all have an important effect on decision-making.</p>
