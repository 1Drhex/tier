            <p class="blog">We can produce heat in a collector by absorbing solar radiation. Assume that the radiation is completely absorbed; also assume that solar radiation does not bring any entropy with it. (This is very nearly true; see Chapter 7.) The hot collector (simply a hot body) emits entropy to an ideal Carnot heat engine and loses heat to the environment at temperature <span class="tex-text">\(T_{a}\)</span> . The loss is modeled in terms of a law such as in Equ.(4.48) with an overall heat loss coefficient h. The engine rejects the entropy received from the collector to a large body of water at a temperature <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}\)</span> , which is larger than <span class="tex-text">\(T_{a}\)</span> thus providing both power and hot water at <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}\)</span> Take values of <span class="tex-text">\(290 K\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(330 K\)</span> for <span class="tex-text">\(T_{a}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}\)</span>, respectively.

(a) The radiation is absorbed by the collector, leading to production of entropy at the temperature of the collector <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1}\)</span>. The rate of absorption of energy from solar radiation (AG ) is equal to the rate of dissipation. (The collector does not do anything else but produce entropy.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The rate of production of entropy from this source must therefore be equal to <span class="tex-text">\(AG / T_{1}\)</span>. On the other hand, entropy flows from the collector to the environment at <span class="tex-text">\(T_{a}\)</span>, leading to more entropy being produced (see Section 4.6). Hence, the rate of production of entropy in the entire system is made up of these two parts (all other processes proceed reversibly):</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Pi_{S}=\frac{A G}{T_{1}}+A h\left(T_{1}-T_{a}\right)\left[\frac{1}{T_{a}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right]\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The minimum of this function is found by differentiating it with respect to the temperature of the collector:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned} \frac{d \Pi_{S}}{d T_{1}} &amp;=-\frac{A G}{T_{1}^{2}}+A h\left[\frac{1}{T_{a}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right]+A h\left(T_{1}-T_{a}\right) \frac{1}{T_{1}^{2}} \\ \frac{d \Pi_{S}}{d T_{1}} &amp;=0 \\ &amp; \Rightarrow \quad T_{1, \min } S=\sqrt{\frac{T_{a}}{h} G+T_{a}^{2}} \end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the given numerical values, the minimum of production of entropy is obtained for a temperature of <span class="tex-text">\(377 K\)</span>. We expect the rate of production of entropy to have a minimum because it should be large for both small and large values of the temperature of the collector but for opposing reasons. At high <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1}\)</span>, the rate of production inside the collector will be small while the losses, and therefore the entropy production due to the flow of heat, must be large. At small values of <span class="tex-text">\(T_{1}\)</span> we have exactly the opposite conditions. Since the effects are nonlinear we can expect a function with a minimum.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The balance of energy for the collector operating at steady-state is given by</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I_{E 2}=A G-A h\left(T_{1}-T_{a}\right)\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
With the help of the relationship between the current of entropy and the current of energy transferred to the heat engine,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(I_{E 2}=T_{1} I_{S 2}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
we can now express the power of the engine:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned} \mathcal{P} &amp;=\left(T_{1}-T_{2}\right) I_{S 2} \\ &amp;=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}} I_{E 2} \\ &amp;=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}\left[A \mathcal{G}-A h\left(T_{1}-T_{a}\right)\right] \end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Its derivative with respect to the temperature of the collector will yield the condition for maximum power:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d \mathcal{P}}{d T_{1}}=\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}^{2}}\left[A G-A h\left(T_{1}-T_{a}\right)\right]-\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}} A h\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d \mathcal{P}}{d T_{1}}=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_{1, \max }{P}=\sqrt{\frac{T_{2}}{h} \mathcal{G}+T_{2} T_{a}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The numerical value is <span class="tex-text">\(402 K\)</span>. The expressions for the minimum of entropy production and the maximum power of the engine will only be the same if the “hot water” produced has the same temperature as the environment.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The rule that minimal production of entropy should deliver maximum output from engines holds only for a single reservoir into which entropy is rejected. In this example, the entropy produced by the absorption of sunlight ends up in two environments which have different temperatures. The loss cannot be calculated by choosing one of the temperatures and multiplying it with the rate of production of entropy. The entropy current rejected to the hot water still represents some available power. We can interpret the power of the engine as being <span class="tex-text">\(100\)</span>% “pure” availability. Therefore, if we add it to the available power of the current of entropy at <span class="tex-text">\(T_{2}\)</span> , we have a quantity whose maximum can be shown to coincide with the minimum of entropy production</p>
