The variables for the model are shown in Figure 7.47 and the file Stock Beta Big Picture. xlsx. The data and the spreadsheet model are in the file Stock Beta Finished.xlsx. This file contains one worksheet named Data that lists the monthly closing prices and corresponding returns for all stocks and the S&amp;P 500 market index. (See Figure 7.48, where a number of rows have been hidden.) The calculations are performed in a sheet named Model, as shown in Figure 7.49. For any selected company, the sheet is set up so that any of the four criteria can be used simply by changing the objective cell in the Solver dialog box. The following steps are required.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> 1 Calculate returns. The downloaded data from the Web are closing prices, not returns. To calculate the returns (in Figure 7.48), enter the formula<br /> =(B5-B4)/B4<br /> in cell B78 on the Data sheet and copy down and across. (Note that there are no returns for January 2011 because the closing prices from December 2010 are not listed.)<br /> 2) Alpha, beta. (From here on, all instructions relate to the Model sheet, shown in Figure 7.49.) Enter any values of alpha and beta in cells B4 and B5. These can be negative or positive.<br /> 3) Copy returns. Copy the S&amp;P 500 returns to column B of the Model sheet, and copy the returns from any selected stock to column C of the Model sheet. Paste each as values.<br /> (The stock returns shown in Figure 7.49 are for McDonald’s.) 4) Predictions. Predict the stock returns from Equation (7.11) by entering the formula<br /> =Alpha+Beta*B10<br /> in cell D10 and copying down.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\widehat{r}_{si} = a + br_{mi}\)</span> (7.11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Errors, squared errors, and absolute errors. The error in any row is the actual stock return minus the predicted stock return. Therefore, enter the formulas<br /> =C10-D10<br /> =E10^2<br /> =ABS(E10)<br /> in cells E10, F10, and G10, respectively, and copy these down.<br /> 6) Weights. (This is for the weighted sum of squares criterion only.) Enter a desired weighting constant in cell B7. Then enter 1 in cell H78, enter the formula<br /> =$B$7*H78<br /> in cell H77, and copy this formula up column H. This makes each weight a constant fraction of the weight below it, so that more recent data are weighted more heavily.<br /> 7) Objectives. To set up four possible objectives, enter the formulas<br /> =SUM(F10:F78)<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(F10:F78,H10:H78)<br /> =SUM(G10:G78)<br /> =MAX(G10:G78)<br /> in cells E4 through E7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box (not shown) should specify that alpha and beta are the decision variables and one of the cells in the range E4:E7, any one you choose, is the objective to minimize. There are no constraints, not even nonnegativity constraints, and the GRG Nonlinear method should be chosen.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 7.49 indicates that McDonald’s is not very sensitive to the market, having a beta less than 1 for the sum of squared errors criterion. If you change the objective, the beta for McDonald’s ranges from about 0.49 to 0.62 across the four criteria (using the weight 0.995 for weighted sum of squares). These results are shown in the top right of Figure 7.49, where each is the optimal beta for a different Solver run, each using a different objective. Clearly, a stock’s beta can depend on which optimality criterion is used.<br /> To run this analysis for any other stock, copy its returns to column C of the Model sheet and rerun Solver with any of the possible objectives. You will find that the betas for different companies can vary widely.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Alternative Modeling Approaches</strong><br /> You might have noticed that we ignored one of our own warnings in this example. Specifically, the SAE and minimax objectives depend on the ABS and MAX functions. Does Solver provide the correct solution for these two criteria? The answer is not a definitive yes, but it appears that the solutions are correct for the problems we solved. Basically, Solver has difficulty with ABS and MAX functions when the objective or constraints are not sufficiently smooth, but it appears that the objectives used here pass the smoothness test. However, it is possible to develop alternative linear models for these two objectives. The advantage, of course, is that the Simplex LP method can then be used, which means that it is guaranteed to find the optimal solution. A full discussion of these alternative models is not presented here, but you can see them in the files Stock Beta 3 Alternative Finished. xlsx and Stock Beta 4 Alternative Finished.xlsx (in the Extra Examples folder). The only drawback to these models is that they rely on modeling tricks that are not obvious.</p>
