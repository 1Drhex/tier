The file Beating S&amp;P 500.xlsx contains monthly returns for a period of almost six years for 27 large companies. The variables for this model are shown in Figure 8.25. (See the file Beating S&amp;P 500 Big Picture.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> You can create the model with the following steps (see Figure 8.26, with many hidden rows and columns, and the file Beating S&amp;P 500.xlsx.)<br /> 1) Enter weights. As in the previous chapter, the portfolio is based on the investment weights, the fractions of each dollar invested in the various stocks. Enter any values for the weights in the Weights range. These weights will eventually be constrained to be between 0 and 1. Then calculate the sum of the weights in cell B9 with the SUM function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Portfolio returns. Calculate the portfolio returns by weighting the actual returns by the weights. To do this, enter the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Weights,B13:AB13)<br /> in cell AD13 and copy it down.<br /> 3) Beats S&amp;P 500? The returns from the S&amp;P 500 market index appear in column AC. (These are given. As with the stock returns, they can be found on the Web.) For each month, see whether the portfolio beats the S&amp;P 500 by entering the formula<br /> =IF(AD13&gt;AC13,&#8221;Yes&#8221;,&#8221;No&#8221;)<br /> in cell AE13 and copying down.<br /> 4) Objective. To find the percentage to minimize in cell G8, enter the formula<br /> =COUNTIF(AE13:AE81,&#8221;Yes&#8221;)/COUNTA(AE13:AE81)<br /> Because of the COUNTIF function, Evolutionary Solver must be used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup appears in Figure 8.27. You should constrain the sum of the weights to be 1 so that all of the money is invested, and you should constrain the weights to be between 0 and 1 so that the investment in each stock is a positive fraction of the total investment. (You can allow negative weights if you want to permit short selling.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> This turns out to be a very difficult optimization problem. We ran Evolutionary Solver from a variety of starting solutions with a variety of settings, and the results were not at all consistent. Therefore, we tried Palisade’s Evolver add-in, which also uses genetic algorithms, and it found the solution in Figure 8.26. (Remember that you have access to Evolver, which is fairly straightforward to use.) We believe this solution is optimal or very close to optimal. The portfolio in this solution beat the S&amp;P 500 about 84% of the time. Of course, there is no guarantee that this portfolio, or any other portfolio, will do as well in future months.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Is this method of portfolio optimization any better or worse than the variance-minimizing method discussed in the previous chapter? The answer depends on the investor’s attitude toward risk. There is no guarantee that the probability-maximizing model in this chapter will achieve any particular expected return, although if it beats the market index consistently, it should provide a decent return. Also, there is no guarantee that this portfolio will provide an acceptable risk—measured by a small variance. Nevertheless, this model might have an intuitive appeal to many investors. If you can beat the S&amp;P 500 consistently, you must be doing a good job.</p>

4:We have not seen this particular objective discussed in finance books or articles, but it is clear from discussions with investors that the goal of “beating the market” is important. For an excellent discussion of investment models in general, read the book by Luenberger (1997).</p>
