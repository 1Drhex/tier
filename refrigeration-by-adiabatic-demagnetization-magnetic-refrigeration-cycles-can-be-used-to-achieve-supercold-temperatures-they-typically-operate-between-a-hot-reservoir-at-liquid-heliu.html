            <p class="blog">Refrigeration by Adiabatic Demagnetization</p> <p class="blog">Magnetic refrigeration cycles can be used to achieve supercold temperatures. They typically operate between a “hot” reservoir at liquid helium temperature (4.4 K) and a cold reservoir at very low temperature (as low as 0.0065 K). One configuration consists of a paramagnetic working material, such as gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) or ferric ammonium alum (FAU), in the form of a rim of a wheel. The wheel is rotated between the high-temperature (4.4 K!)<br /> reservoir and the low-temperature reservoir. In the high-temperature reservoir, the working material expels heat as it is subjected to a large magnetic fi eld (7 tesla). As the working material is rotated into the low-temperature reservoir, the fi eld slowly becomes smaller and eventually zero. This demagnetization process may be assumed to be adiabatic and reversible. As the working material demagnetizes, it cools off. When the working material is then exposed to a low-temperature reservoir, it absorbs heat. From a molecular basis, explain how adiabatic demagnetization cools the working material.</p>

A paramagnetic material consists of many unpaired electrons, each of which has a definite spin state (spin-up or spin-down). In the absence of a magnetic field, the energies of each of the electron states are identical. Thus, an equal number of electrons will occupy each state. When a magnetic fi eld is applied to the material, the energies of the spin-up and spindown states are no longer identical. Consequently, more electrons occupy the lower energy state then the upper energy state. A schematic of the spin states with a magnetic field (state 1) and without a magnetic field (state 2) is illustrated in Figure E3.19.</p>

The entropy of this system can be thought of as having two components, that due to magnetization, <span class="tex-text">\(S_{\text {magnetization }}\)</span> and that due to temperature, <span class="tex-text">\(S_{\text {temperature }}\)</span>. We first consider <span class="tex-text">\(S_{\text {magnetization }}\)</span>. Inspection of Figure E3.19 shows that there are fewer confi gurations possible (less disorder) in state 1, with the magnetic fi eld applied, than in state 2. Thus, the entropy due to magnetization increases during the demagnetization process as the working material goes from state 1 to 2:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta s_{\text {magnetization }}&gt;0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
However, since the overall process is reversible and adiabatic, the entropy change is zero:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta s=0=\Delta s_{\text {magnetization }}+\Delta s_{\text {temperature }}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus,</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta s_{\text {temperature }}&lt;0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The entropy of the temperature component is lowered as the temperature decreases, that is,</p>

It is interesting to compare the two states in an adiabatic demagnetization cycle (Figure E3.19) with those in the conventional vapor-compression refrigeration cycle described in Section 3.9. Both cycles rely on the working substance absorbing heat from a cold reservoir as the working substance goes from a more ordered state to a less ordered state. In this example, the liquid-to-vapor transition of conventional refrigeration is replaced with the demagnetization of the paramagnetic material. Similarly, in both cycles, heat is rejected to a hot reservoir as the working substance transits to a more ordered state (liquid or magnetic). This example illustrates one approach to creatively developing engineering processes—applying the same fundamental approach in a new way that is better suited for the given application. Clearly, the super-low temperatures obtained by adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration systems could not be obtained by a conventional liquid–vapor transition, since vapors do not exist at these temperatures. However, in developing this process, the same fundamental type of process (i.e., ordered-to-disordered transition) is exploited. It is just accomplished in a way that is appropriate for the application, where the ordered-to-disordered transition occurs within a solid. Many clever engineering processes have been created by applying analogous fundamental mechanisms in this manner.</p>
