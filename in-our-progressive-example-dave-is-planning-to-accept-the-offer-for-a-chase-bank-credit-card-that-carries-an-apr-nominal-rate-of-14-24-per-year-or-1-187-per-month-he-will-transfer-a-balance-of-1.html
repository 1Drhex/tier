            <p class="blog">In our Progressive Example, Dave is planning to accept the offer for a Chase Bank credit card that carries an APR (nominal rate) of 14.24% per year, or 1.187% per month. He will transfer a balance of $1000 and plans to pay it and the transfer fee of $30, due at the end of the first month. Let’s assume that Dave makes the transfer, and only days later his employer has a 1-year assignment for him in the country of Cameroon in West Africa. Dave accepts the employment offer, and in his hurried, excited departure, he forgets to send the credit card service company a change of address. Since he is now out of mail touch, he does not pay his monthly balance due, which we calculated in Example 4.2 to be $1041.87.</p> <p class="blog">(a) If this situation continues for a total of 12 months, determine the total due after 12 months and the effective annual rate of interest Dave has accumulated. Remember, the fine print on the card’s interest and fee information states a penalty APR of 29.99% per year after one late payment of the minimum payment amount, plus a late payment fee of $39 per occurrence.<br /> (b) If there were no penalty APR and no late-payment fee, what effective annual interest rate would be charged for this year? Compare this rate with the answer in part (a).</p>

(a) Because Dave did not pay the first month’s amount, the new balance of $1041.87 and all future monthly balances will accumulate interest at the higher monthly rate of</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">29.99%∕12 = 2.499% per month</p>
 <p class="blog">
Additionally, the $39 late-payment fee will be added each month, starting with the second month, and interest will be charged on these fees also each month thereafter. The first 3 months and last 2 months are detailed below. Figure 4–3 details the interest and fees for all 12 months.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Month 1: 1000 + 1000(0.01187) + 30 = $1041.87<br /> Month 2: 1041.87 + 1041.87(0.02499) + 39 = $1106.91<br /> Month 3: 1106.91 + 1106.91(0.02499) + 39 = $1173.57<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> .<br /> Month 11: 1689.25 + 1689.25(0.02499) + 39 = $1770.46<br /> Month 12: 1770.46 + 1770.46(0.02499) + 39 = $1853.71<br /> <em>The effective monthly rate</em> is determined by using the <em>F∕P</em> factor to find the <em>i</em> value at which $1000 now is equivalent to $1853.71 after 12 periods.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(1853.71 = 1000(F∕P,i,12) = 1000(1 + i)^{12}\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(1 + i = (1.85371)^{1∕12} = 1.05278\)</span><br /> <span class="tex-text">\(i = 5.278\%\)</span> per month</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the compounding period is 1 month, use Equation [4.3] <span class="tex-text">\( i_{a}=(1+i)^{m} -1\)</span> to determine <em>the effective annual rate</em> of 85.375% per year, compounded monthly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i_{a}=(1+i)^{m} -1= (1.05278)^{12} − 1= 0.85375 (85.375\%)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
b) If there were no penalty fees for late payments and the nominal annual rate of 14.24% (or 1.187% per month) were applied throughout the 12 months, the effective annual rate would be 15.207% per year, compounded monthly. By Equation [4.3], with a small rounding error included,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i_{a}=(1+i)^{m} -1= (1.01187)^{12} − 1= 0.15207\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
First, Dave will not pay at the stated rate of 14.24%, because this is the APR (nominal rate), not the APY (effective rate) of 15.207%. Second, and much more important, is the huge difference made by (1) the increase in rate to an APR of 29.99% and (2) the monthly fees of $39 for not making a payment. These large fees become part of the credit balance and accumulate interest at the penalty rate of 29.99% per year. The result is an effective annual rate jump from 15.207% to 85.375% per year, compounded monthly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comment</strong><br /> This is but one illustration of why the best advice to an individual or company in debt is to spend down the debt. The quoted APR by credit card, loan, and mortgage institutions can be quite deceiving; plus, the addition of penalty fees increases the effective rate very rapidly.</p>
