The following matters have been marked for your attention:<br /> (i) The draft financial statements indicate a turnover of $500m and a profit of $50m.<br /> (ii) The directors have made no provision for the costs that are likely to be incurred as a result of a damages claim for $2.4m, which is being pursued by one of the company’s customers. G’s legal department and its lawyers are quite sure that this claim will have to be met in full.<br /> (iii) The directors have not provided for a sum of $2.3m which ought to be written off in respect of debts that are almost certainly irrecoverable.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Explain the implications for your audit report of the matters described in (ii) and (iii) above.<br /> Your answer should make a clear statement of the type of report which you consider appropriate, although a full audit report is not required.<br /> (b) It has been suggested that the quality of audit reporting could be improved enormously if accounting standards were clearer and auditors had more explicit guidance on issues such as materiality.<br /> Discuss this suggestion, making it clear how improved guidance on financial reporting might support the auditor.</p>

(a) The first question to be resolved is whether these amounts are material. If they are not then it would not matter whether the auditor disagreed or not.<br /> Bear in mind that either item might be immaterial when taken on its own but the combined effect could be material. Both items tend to overstate profits and so we should consider whether their total value is misleading.<br /> One half of 1 per cent of turnover = $2.5 million, as does 5 per cent of profit. This suggests that neither item is material in itself, but that the two taken together lead to a material overstatement of profits. If the directors refuse to alter their treatment of them then the auditor will have to qualify the audit report.</p>
 <p class="blog">
IAS 37 requires that item (ii) should be accrued. This is on the grounds that the payment is probable and the amount can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. This accrual would reduce profits by $2.4 million and would create a current liability of the<br /> same amount.<br /> The bad debt should be written off because of the need for prudence in the valuation of assets and recognition of losses. There is also a need to match the loss to the same period as the loss arose. This means that both profits and receivables should be decreased by $2.3 million.<br /> In the absence of any change by the directors, we will need to qualify the financial statements on the grounds of disagreement. The extent of our disagreement is not so serious as to warrant an adverse opinion and so we will use the ‘except for’ form of words.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The ambiguity of accounting standards is a major problem for the auditor. It is possible to create a slightly misleading impression without breaching any of the formal standards. It can be difficult for the auditor to justify a change to the financial statements if the directors argue that their treatment falls within the requirements of local company law and accounting standards. These same directors can, of course, seek out the loopholes and ambiguities in the standards in order to achieve the desired effect on the statements.<br /> If accounting standards could be made clearer and less ambiguous then the auditor could find it easier to demonstrate that a particular treatment was unacceptable. On the other hand, the statements might not be any more useful because the greater clarity might be arrived at by making the requirements more rigid – thereby reducing the scope for deciding on the most realistic treatment.<br /> The other major problem facing the auditor is over the determination of materiality. It is never clear where the precise cut-off between material and immaterial actually lies. The danger is that the directors are aware of this and could bias the figures until just before the point at which the auditor would be forced to treat the matter as a material disagreement.<br /> Greater clarity over materiality might help, but it could also provide management with a better idea of exactly how far they could push the figures. This suggests that it might not improve the overall quality of financial reporting and auditing.</p>
