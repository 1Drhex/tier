(a) Materiality is the quality that determines whether a matter is worth reporting or disclosing. A matter is material if knowledge of it would alter the behaviour of the users of the financial statements. Thus, the auditor would not normally be concerned about whether something that was immaterial was disclosed in the financial statements or, indeed, uncovered during the audit. Normally, materiality is determined by size. A matter might be considered material because it exceeds a particular percentage of profit or sales revenue. Materiality can also be associated with qualitative issues. For example, a small error in the disclosure of directors’ remuneration if required might not be material because of its size, but could still be of some significance to the shareholders because they take a keen interest in the amounts paid to directors.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Materiality is important to the auditor because the audit is essentially about detecting and reporting material irregularities. Audit tests will be designed to uncover material misstatements. Thus, deciding on a materiality threshold will influence the amount of audit work carried out. Materiality will also affect the reporting decision. Auditors are required to decide whether the financial statements give a true and fair view. It does not really matter whether the auditor agrees with everything in the accounts provided any disagreement is immaterial.<br /> (b) The auditor’s duty is to form an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements and to report that opinion to the shareholders. The auditor’s responsibilities are, therefore, far narrower than many readers of financial statements realise. For example, the auditor does not prepare the statements, that is the responsibility of the directors.<br /> Forming an opinion on fairness involves a number of subsidiary duties. The auditor must, for example, gather sufficient evidence to support this opinion. The auditor must also consider whether the accounting policies are acceptable, for example, do they comply with international accounting standards?<br /> The auditor has no specific duty to prevent or detect fraud. The auditor must, however, consider the possibility that the statements might have been distorted in order to conceal some fraud. For example, an employee might attempt to conceal the theft of some cash by deliberately understating sales by the amount stolen. The auditor would have no direct interest in the theft itself, but would be concerned if the amount stolen was material because that would lead to a material understatement of the sales figure.<br /> The question of the auditor’s duty to report fraud is complicated by the fact that the shareholders might consider any serious fraud to indicate mismanagement on the part of the directors. That could, in turn, lead to the materiality threshold being lower for fraudulent irregularities than for those due to errors. Furthermore, the detection of fraud will normally be complicated by the fact that some attempt will have been made to conceal the theft. That will mean that the auditor will often feel less confident that all significant fraud has been detected.</p>
