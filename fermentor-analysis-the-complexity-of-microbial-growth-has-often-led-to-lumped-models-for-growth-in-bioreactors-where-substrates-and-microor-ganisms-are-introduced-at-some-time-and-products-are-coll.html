            <p class="blog"><strong>FERMENTOR ANALYSIS. </strong>The complexity of microbial growth has often led to lumped models for growth in bioreactors, where substrates and microor-ganisms are introduced at some time, and products are collected at some later time, and the behavior of the reaction is simply based on the components. We will take this example through the book and examine how well the simple models we can develop work for this complex system.<br /> Taking an experimental study (Tobajas et al., 2003), we examine the growth of Candida utilis in a Biostat UD 30 internal-loop airlift bioreactor, as shown in Figure 2.3. This is a semibatch mixed–plug reactor,but, as we will show, the pertinent model equations are the same as those for a batch reactor because the concentration of oxygen in the flowing gas stream is essentially constant.<br /> The working volume of this fermentor is 33 L, and the fermentor is initially charged with media containing glucose, salts, and yeast extract to provide a proper environment for growth of the microorganisms and maintained at a pH of 5.0 and a temperature of <span class="tex-text">\(30^{\circ }\)</span>C throughout the growth. During growth, air is sparged through the culture at sufficient levels to provide the required oxygen for metabolism. In this chapter, we focus on the consumption of the major limiting substrate, glucose, by the cells, and the subsequent growth of the cells (biomass) as a result of this. These values are typically easy to measure – carbohydrates can be determined by a spectroscopic method or with a glucose probe. Biomass can be determined by a direct cell count by microscopy or by an indirect measurement of cell mass (wet or dry cell mass) or optical density and conversion by use of a standard curve developed in prior studies. Similar to chemical reacting systems, the critical aspect is to decide what we want or need to measure and to develop the characteristic equations.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/07/mm-768x460.png"></div>

However, solution of the model equations is also straight-forward with Matlab or another program, by minimizing the error between model and experimental data. By setting this constraint as a fixed minimum, or demand-ing a certain number of iterations, we can then find that <span class="tex-text">\(k_{1} \)</span>= 0.165 L/g h and <span class="tex-text">\(k_{2} \)</span>= 0.096 L/g h, giving the resulting plots for the model fits shown in Figure 2.4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the simplest possible constitutive equation fits the data reasonably well, but not perfectly, particularly at late times, because the growth depends on the substrate in a more complex way. One possibility is the effect of oxygen depletion, necessitating an oxygen balance equation, which is discussed in Chapter 8. A curve fit of the data also does not necessarily give insight into the mechanism of growth. When the cells consume nutrients, they use them for other metabolic functions besides growth. This is particularly true in early and late growth stages. These inefficiencies in growth are well established and can be accounted for in many ways. One way to do this is to limit the examination of the fit of the experimental behavior during the cell’s maximal growth stage, when nutrients are in excess, and cells are growing at their maximal rate, often called “exponential growth.” To try to fit all of the experimental data, we utilize a constitutive equation that is typically used to describe the inefficiencies in substrate consumption during early and late stage growth, a Monod-type relationship. Thus the model equations for cell growth and substrate consumption become</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dC_{A}}{dt}=+K_{1}C_{A}\frac{C_{B}}{K_{B}+C_{B}}\)</span> (2.2.15)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{dC_{B}}{dt}=-K_{2}C_{B}\frac{C_{B}}{K_{B}+C_{B}}\)</span> (2.2.16)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(K_{B}\)</span> is essentially another fit parameter. Figure 2.5 shows the result of the model fit for these equations, where<span class="tex-text">\( k_{1}\)</span> = 0.34 L/g h, <span class="tex-text">\(k_{2} \)</span>= 0.48 L/g h, and<span class="tex-text">\( K_{B}\)</span> =0.64 g/L. As we see from the figure, the data over all the time are well fit by the new model. This model is sufficient for this organism to describe the growth of the cell and consumption of substrate in batch, and could likely be used to scale up the system to larger growth. However, if the organism were grown under different conditions, an alternative fit (alternative rate constants) would likely be needed.</p>
