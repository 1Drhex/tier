            <p class="blog">Determine the revenues, construction costs, cash receipts, and cash disbursements for a construction company that currently has three projects under contract for the next year and anticipates picking up a fourth project during the year. For the first project, the project’s owner is holding $50,000 in retention from this year’s payments and will continue to hold 10% retention on all payments during the next year. The construction company is holding $26,000 retention on its subcontractors from this year’s payments. The retention for this project is expected to be released in June. The estimated bill to the project’s owner and construction costs for the first project are shown in Table 1 . For the second project, the project’s owner is holding $150,000 in retention from this year’s payments and will continue to hold 5% retention on all payments during the next year. The construction company is holding $82,000 retention on its subcontractors from this year’s payments. The project is expected to go on for another 15 months; therefore, the retention for this project is not expected to be released next year (the year for which we are making the projections). The estimated bill to the project’s owner and construction costs for the second project are shown in Table 2 . The third project is expected to start in February. The project’s owner will hold 10% retention on all payments during the year. The retention for this project is expected to be released in December. The construction company will withhold retention from the payments to its subcontractors. The estimated bill to the project’s owner and construction costs for the third project are shown in Table 3 . The company anticipates picking up a fourth project from a current customer with a start date of October. The owner of this project will not hold retention. The estimated bill to the project’s owner and construction costs for the fourth project are shown in Table 4 . The company’s fiscal and tax year starts in January and ends in December. The company uses the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from the project’s owner are received before the end of the month after the company bills its clients. Labor costs are paid weekly. Material bills are paid in full when the payment is received from the owner. Subcontractor bills are paid— less retention—when payment is received from the owner. The retention withheld from the subcontractor payments is based on the same retention rate that is held by the project’s owner and will be paid to the subcontractor when the owner releases the retention. Other costs are paid at the end of the month the costs are incurred.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="1067"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="402">Table 1 Bill to Owner and Construction Costs for the First Project</td> <td width="225"></td> <td width="150"></td> <td width="140"></td> <td width="150"></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan="3">Costs</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Bill to Owner ($)</td> <td>Material ($)</td> <td>Labor ($)</td> <td>Sub.

First, let’s look at revenues. Because the com-pany uses the percentage-of-completion method, the rev-enues are recognized when the company bills the owner; therefore, the monthly revenues equal the monthly billings to the project’s owners. The revenues for January are cal-culated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Revenues_{Jan}\)</span>= $448,000 + $320,000 + $0 + $0</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Revenues_{Jan}\)</span>= $768,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
The revenues for the remaining months of the year are cal-culated in a similar manner. The revenues for next year are shown in Table 5 .</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 442px" width="542"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="422">Table 5 Revenues for Next Year</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Revenues ($)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jan.</td> <td>768,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Feb</td> <td>712,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March</td> <td>785,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April</td> <td>769,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May</td> <td>560,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>June</td> <td>545,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July</td> <td>500,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aug</td> <td>391,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sept</td> <td>342,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oct</td> <td>460,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nov</td> <td>492,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dec</td> <td>516,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>6,840,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Next, let’s look at materials costs. Because the com-pany uses the percentage-of-completion method, the construction costs are recognized when the company re-ceives the material bill; therefore, the material bills are re-ceived in the same month that the costs are recognized. This is true for labor, subcontractor, and other costs. We begin by calculating materials costs in December of the current year, because these costs will be paid in Janu-ary of next year and are needed to calculate January’s cash flow. December’s materials costs are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Material_{Dec}\)</span>= $132,000 + $54,000 + $0 + $0</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Material_{Dec}\)</span>= $186,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
For this sample problem, the material suppliers were paid when payment was received from the project’s owner; therefore, they will be paid in the month following receipt of their bill. When the payment terms for material suppli-ers are different from this, the cash flow should be adjusted to match the actual cash flow created by payment of their bills. The materials costs for next year are calculated in a similar manner and are shown in Table 6 .</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 444px" width="519"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="290">Table 6 Materials Costs for Next Year</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Materials ($)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jan.</td> <td>193,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Feb</td> <td>207,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March</td> <td>191,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April</td> <td>182,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May</td> <td>122,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>June</td> <td>114,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July</td> <td>97,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aug</td> <td>96,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sept</td> <td>80,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oct</td> <td>106,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nov</td> <td>105,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dec</td> <td>144,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>1,637,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Next, let’s look at labor costs. To simplify calcula-tions, we assume all labor is paid during the month that it was performed, although the labor costs for the last weeks of the month will be paid during the first week of the next month. If labor is paid every two weeks, a bet-ter assumption would be that half of this month’s and half of last month’s labor is paid during this month. The payment assumption should try to predict the actual cash flow without overcomplicating the calculations. We begin by calculating labor costs in January of next year because December’s costs will be recorded and paid in December. The labor costs for January are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Labor Costs_{Jan}\)</span>= $109,000 + $89,000 + $0 + $0</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Labor Costs_{Jan}\)</span>= $198,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
The labor costs for the remaining months of the year are calculated in a similar manner. The labor costs for next year are shown in Table 7.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="422"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="422">Table 7 Labor Costs for Next Year</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Labor ($)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jan.</td> <td>198,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Feb</td> <td>196,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March</td> <td>178,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April</td> <td>181,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May</td> <td>133,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>June</td> <td>114,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July</td> <td>100,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aug</td> <td>91,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sept</td> <td>81,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oct</td> <td>106,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nov</td> <td>100,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dec</td> <td>144,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>1,622,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
Next, let’s look at subcontractor costs. Because the company uses the percentage-of-completion method, the subcontractor costs are recognized when the com-pany receives the subcontractor’s bill. We begin by cal-culating subcontractor costs in December of the current year because these costs will be paid in January of next year and are needed to calculate January’s cash flow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The subcontractor costs for December of the current year are calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Sub.Costs_{Dec}\)</span>= $193,000 + $18,000 + $0 + $0</p>
 <p class="blog">

Next, let’s look at the other costs. Because the com-pany uses the percentage-of-completion method, the con-struction costs are recognized when the company receives the bills. We begin by calculating the other costs in January of next year because December’s costs will be recorded and paid in December. The other costs for January are cal-culated as follows :</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Other Costs_{Jan}\)</span>= $15,000 + $17,000 + $0 + $0</p>

 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 440px" width="528"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" width="422">Table 9 Other Costs for Next Year</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Other ($)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jan.</td> <td>32,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Feb</td> <td>37,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March</td> <td>37,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April</td> <td>35,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May</td> <td>29,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>June</td> <td>31,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July</td> <td>32,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aug</td> <td>29,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sept</td> <td>26,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oct</td> <td>50,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nov</td> <td>42,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dec</td> <td>39,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>419,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
The total construction costs for each month of next year equal the sum of the material, labor, subcontract, and other costs for each month. The total construction costs for January are calculated as follows:</p>

Next, let’s look at cash receipts. The company ex-pects that the cash receipts will occur in the month fol-lowing the recognizing of the revenue and will be reduced by the retention held by the project’s owner. The reason the cash receipt occurs in the following month is because revenue is recognized when the owner is billed rather than when the cash is received under the percentage-of-com-pletion accounting method. An additional cash receipt will occur when the project’s owner releases the retention. The cash receipts—except for the receipt when the project’s owner releases retention—for each project are calculated as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash Receipt_{n}=Revenues_{n-1}(1 &#8211; Retention Rate)\)</span> <p class="blog">
When the project’s owner releases retention, the cash re-ceipt will equal the current month’s payment plus all of the retention withheld by the project’s owner.<br /> For the first project, the owner holds 10% retention; therefore, January’s cash receipt from the project is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Receipt_{Jan}\)</span>= $504,000(1 &#8211; 0.10) = $453,600</p>
 <p class="blog">
The retention withheld from January’s payments is calcu-lated as follows:</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Retention_{n}\)</span>= $504,000(0.10) = $50,400</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash receipts and retention held for February through May are calculated in a similar manner.<br /> In June the retention will be released, which will include the $50,000 held during this year plus the retention held from next year’s payments. The June cash receipt is calcu-lated as follows:</p>

For the third project, the first cash receipt will be re-ceived in March and the owners will hold 10% retention. In December the retention withheld will be released.

Next, let’s look at cash disbursements. Because the timing of the disbursements is different for materials, labor, subcontractors, and other costs, these costs need to be addressed separately. The cash disbursements for each project will be calculated separately because retention is withheld from the subcontractor’s payments and the reten-tion rates vary from project to project.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash disbursements for materials will occur in the month following the receipt of the bill for the materials. Be-cause retention will not be withheld from the payments, the cash disbursement will equal the materials costs from the previous month. January’s cash disbursements for materi-als on the first project are $132,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash disbursements for labor will occur throughout the month the labor costs are incurred. To simplify calcula-tions, we assume all labor is paid during the month that it was performed, although the labor costs for the last weeks of the month will be paid during the first week of the next month. January’s cash disbursements for labor on the first project are $109,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash disbursements to subcontractors will occur in the month following the receipt of the bill from the sub-contractors. For the first project, 10% retention is withheld from the subcontractor’s payments; therefore, the cash dis-bursement for January is calculated as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Sub. Cash Disbursements_{n}=Sub. _{n-1}(1 &#8211; Retention Rate)\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Sub. Cash Disbursements_{Jan }\)</span>= $193,000(1 &#8211; 0.10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Sub. Cash Disbursements_{Jan }\)</span>= $173,700</p>
 <p class="blog">
The retention withheld from January’s payment to the sub-contractors is calculated as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Retention_{n}=Revenues_{n-1}(Retention Rate)\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Retention_{n}\)</span>= $193,000(0.10) = $19,300</p>
 <p class="blog">
For other types of costs the cash disbursements will occur at the end of the month in which the other costs occur. Jan-uary’s cash disbursements for other costs on the first proj-ect are $15,000. The total cash disbursements for the first project are the sum of the cash disbursements for materials, labor, subcontractors, and other costs. The cash disbursement for January is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Disbursements_{Jan}\)</span>= $132,000 + $109,000 + $173,700 + $15,000</p>

 <p class="blog">
The cash disbursements for the remaining months are calculated in a similar manner, except for the cash dis-bursements to subcontractors for the month of June. In June the retention will be released to the subcontractors, which will include the $26,000 held during the previous year and the retention held from this year’s payments. June’s cash disbursements to subcontractors are calcu-lated as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Sub. Cash Disbursements_{June}\)</span>= $26,000 + $19,300 + $19,200 + $14,500 + $22,000 + $10,500</p>
