            <p class="blog"><strong>To Produce or Not to Produce?−−That is the Question</strong></p> <p class="blog">A manufacturing plant consists of three departments:A, B,and C. Department A occupies 100 square meters in one corner of the plant. Product X is one of several products being produced in Department A. The daily production of Product X is 576 pieces. The cost accounting records show the following average daily production costs for Product X:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 330px" width="713"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center">Direct labor</p> <p style="text-align: center"> </td> <td style="text-align: center" width="144">(1 operator working 4 hours per day</p> <p class="blog">at $22.50/hr, including fringe benefits,</p> <p class="blog">plus a part-time foreman at $30 per day</td> <td style="text-align: center" width="144">$120.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center" width="144">Direct material</td> <td style="text-align: center" width="144">(at $0.82 per square meter of floor area)</td> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center">86.40</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center">Overhead</p> </td> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center"> </td> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center">82.00</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center"> </td> <td style="text-align: center" width="144">Total cost per day=</td> <td width="144"> <p style="text-align: center">$288.40</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">The department foreman has recently learned about an outside company that sells Product X at $0.35 per piece. Accordingly, the foreman figured a cost per day of $0.35(576) = $201.60, resulting in a daily savings of $288.40−$201.60 = $86.80.Therefore, a proposal was submitted to the plant manager for shutting down the production line of Product X and buying it from the outside company.However, after examining each component separately, the plant manager decided not to accept the foreman’s proposal based on the unit cost of Product X:</p> <p class="blog">1. Direct labor:Because the foreman was supervising the manufacture of other products in Department A in addition to Product X, the only possible savings in labor would occur if the operator working 4 hours per day on Product X were not reassigned after this line is shut down. That is, a maximum savings of $90.00 per day would result.<br /> 2. Materials:The maximum savings on direct material will be $86.40. However,this figure could be lower if some of the material for Product X is obtained from scrap of another product.<br /> 3. Overhead:Because other products are made in Department A, no reduction in total floor space requirements will probably occur. Therefore, no reduction in overhead costs will result from discontinuing Product X. It has been estimated that there will be daily savings in the variable overhead costs traceable to Product X of about $3.00 due to a reduction in power costs and in insurance premiums.</p>

If the manufacture of Product X is discontinued, the firm will save at most $90.00 in<br /> direct labor, $86.40 in direct materials, and $3.00 in variable overhead costs, which totals $179.40 per day. This estimate of actual cost savings per day is less than the potential savings indicated by the cost accounting records ($288.40 per day), and it would not exceed the $201.60 to be paid to the outside company if Product X is purchased. For this reason, the plant manager used Rule 2 and rejected the proposal of the foreman and continued the manufacture of Product X.<br /> In conclusion, Example 2-11 shows how an erroneous decision might be made by using the unit cost of Product X from the cost accounting records without detailed analysis. The fixed cost portion of Product X’s unit cost, which is present even if the manufacture of Product X is discontinued, was not properly accounted for in the original analysis by the foreman.</p>
