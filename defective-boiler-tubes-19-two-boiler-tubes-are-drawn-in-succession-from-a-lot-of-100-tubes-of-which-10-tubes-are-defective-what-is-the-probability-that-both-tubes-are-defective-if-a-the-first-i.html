The probability of event A, P(A), can be interpreted as a theoretical relative frequency; i.e., a number about which the relative frequency of event A tends to cluster as n, the number of times a random equipment (on the event) is performed, increases indefinitely. This is the objective interpretation of probability. Probability can also be interpreted subjectively as a measure of the degree of belief, on a scale from 0 to 1, that the event A occurs. This interpretation is frequently used in ordinary conversation. For example, if someone says, “The probability I (the author) will go to the racetrack today is 90%,” then 90% is a measure of the person’s belief that he or she will go to the racetrack. This interpretation is also used when, in the absence of concrete data needed to estimate an unknown probability on the basis of observed relative frequency, the personal opinion of an expert is sought to provide the estimate.</p>

The conditional probability of event B given A is denoted by P(B | A) and defined as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P(B | A) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{P(AB)}{P(A)}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
where P(AB) is the probability that events A and B will occur. P(B | A) can be interpreted as the proportions of A occurrences that also include the occurrence of B.</p>

First determine the probability that the first tube is defective, P(A). Since 10 out of 100 are defective:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P(A) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{10}{100}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Determine the probability that the second tube is defective if the first is replaced, P(B). Since the first tube is replaced, the probability for the defective tube is the same:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P(B) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{10}{100}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Determine the probability that the two tubes are defective if the first is replaced, i.e., P(AB):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P(AB) = P(A)P(B)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(=\left\lgroup\frac{10}{100}\right\rgroup\left\lgroup\frac{10}{100}\right\rgroup\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{100}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Determine the probability that the second tube is defective if the first tube is not replaced, i.e., P(B | A). Since the remaining lot contained 99 tubes:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P(B | A) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{10-1}{100-1}=\frac{9}{99}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, determine the probability that both tubes are defective if the first tube is not replaced, that is, P'(AB):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P'(AB) = P(A)P(B | A)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(=\left\lgroup\frac{10}{100}\right\rgroup\left\lgroup\frac{9}{99}\right\rgroup\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{1}{110}\)</span></p>

Conditional probability can be used to formulate a definition for the independence of two events A and B. Event B is defined to be independent of event A only if P(B | A) = P (B). Similarly, event A is defined to be independent of event B if and only if P(A| B) = P(A). From the definition of conditional probability, one can deduce the logically equivalent definition of the independence of event A and event B if and only if P(AB) = P(A)P(B).</p>
