            <p class="blog">Design an optimally sized solar collec tor system for Sacramento, California, and estimate how much useful energy the system will provide in an average year, and its monetary value. The solar heating system will heat only water. You are considering a solar collector with rating data as follows:<span class="tex-text">\(F_{R} U_{L}=4.57 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \text { and } F_{R} \tau \alpha=0.737\)</span> The collector tilt angle will be the latitude plus 5° for overall yearly performance, or 43° from the horizontal. The area of each individual collector is 2 m<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span>.</p> <p class="blog">The expected effectiveness of the heat exchanger in the heat storage tank you plan to use is 0.75.</p> <p class="blog">Use G = 0.014 kg s<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span> m<span class="tex-text">\(^{-2}\)</span> and c<span class="tex-text">\(_p\)</span> = 3500 J kg<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span> K<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span>, as representing the heat transfer fluid. Storage will be 50 L m<span class="tex-text">\(^{-2}\)</span>, based on collector area. This is on the low end of the suggested range of 50 to 100 L m<span class="tex-text">\(^{-2}\)</span> but the solar climate in Sacramento is consistent from day to day, making a large thermal storage unnecessary.</p> <p class="blog">Tentative estimates of costs include $750 per collector module, $2500 for pumps, piping, controls, and so on, and $2.00/L of thermal storage, heat exchanger included. Conventional water heating is by electricity at $0.16/kWh.</p> <p class="blog">Design for a family of four, with one additional adult who will live in the home from June through September. Make a reasonable assumption of daily water use of the household. Water specific heat is 4180 J kg<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span> K<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span>. The home is located at latitude 38.5° north. Meteorological data for Sacramento are in Table 11-1. Snow is rare in Sacramento; assume ground reflectivity of 0.2 for all months.</p> <p class="blog">Dealing with an NPV analysis is outside the scope of this example. As a simplified alternative, assume the installation cost will be amortized at a yearly cost of 12% of the installed cost. That is, when loan repayment, property taxes, maintenance, and operating costs are considered, they sum to 12% of the installed cost. Additionally, assume (for simplicity purposes) that there are no tax credits or deductions, or other rebates, available to reduce the installation cost.</p>

Heating load: Assume each person will use 100 L of hot water on a daily basis, which is heated from 15 to 55°C. Water main temperature is typically equal to the yearly average air temperature of the region, which is 15°C in Sacramento. Water heating set point temperature is often 60°C, but this is above the pain threshold level for humans. If the temperature is lower (such as 50°C), thermal losses are less and collector efficiency will be slightly greater. Assume a 55°C temperature as a compromise. Each person requires the following for hot water every day.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(100 L)(1 kg/L)(4180 J/kg · K)(55 – 15 K) = 16.7E6 J</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thermal storage loses some of the collected energy through parasitic loss. Assume 25% of the collected heat will be lost this way, from pipes and storage. Thus, each person will require 16.7 E6 J/0.75 = 22.3 E6 J day<span class="tex-text">\(^{-1}\)</span> for hot water. The monthly heat need, based on these assumptions, is in Table 11-2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Conventional energy cost: Each kWh of purchased energy will cost $0.16 and provide 3.6 MJ.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Assuming electric heating has 100% efficiency (resistance heating). Thus, the value of each GJ of heat (conventional or solar) is (1E9/3.6E6)($0.16) = $44.44.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Analysis: The data provided are sufficient to calculate the f-value and energy savings for every month of the year if the collector area is known. The optimum area is unknown. To find it, a sequence of areas will be analyzed and the best one chosen. The process can be best accomplished using a computer language such as Matlab, or a spreadsheet, but is presented here as a series of tables that could be mimicked in a spreadsheet, for example.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first step is to determine the average daily insolation on the collectors for each month of the year. The procedure detailed earlier in this chapter is used, based on data in Table 11-1, to calculate the following values of insolation on a south-facing collector installed at a 43° tilt angle (and other assumptions listed above) to obtain the data in Table 11-3.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Values for X and Y depend on collector area. For simplicity of presentation, X/A and Y/A are calculated separately and are listed in Table 11-4. For each collector area, values in Table 11-4 are multiplied by the corresponding A (area, m2) to find X and Y values, which then are used to calculate the monthly f-values. For example, for a system using four collectors, the total area is 8 m2 and the corresponding X, Y, and f data are as listed in Table 11-5.</p>

Table 11-5 contains data for a single collector array—4 collectors with a total area of 8 m<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>. Yearly energy supplied by the collectors is the sum of the monthly GJ, or 23.66, at a value of $44.44/GJ, which is a total value of $1050. Comparable calculations should be made for other areas. For example, considering 2 . . . 8 collectors, with areas of 4 . . . 16 m<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>, leads to the data in Table 11-6.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The final calculations are for the yearly cost of the collector array, to be used to compare to the benefits listed in Table 11-6. Considering the assumed costs of the problem description, amortized at 12% yearly, cost data in Table 11-7 apply.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The final column in Table 11-7 contains the most important data—the net yearly benefit. The data can also be graphed, as in Fig. 11-17. There is a definite optimum collector array size (12 m<span class="tex-text">\(^2\)</span>, or 6 collectors) resulting from the diminishing returns behavior as the collector area increases, combined with steadily increasing costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Final thoughts: Although the example of solar house design was presented as a relatively straightforward process, such is seldom the case in practice. Important caveats include the following considerations:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Weather varies from year to year and the parameter values used in the example come from historical data. There is no guarantee they will apply in the future. Climate change may improve or diminish benefits. Local development that adds air pollution and changes insolation values can occur (or, to be optimistic, local and regional strict air pollution controls may reduce air pollution and increase insolation).</p>

2. The assumed quantity of hot water use per person per day is based on using half of the current average practice in the United States. Simple water savings measures can reduce use even further. An unexpected result of conservation may be that a solar collector array is no longer attractive based on economic return in today’s situation. This may be the case for any renewable energy scenario based on taking conservation measures very seriously. If the need is small, savings, of necessity, will be small and the monetary advantage of adding a renewable system may be lost. This is not a negative outcome, for energy is saved either way. Conservation is often the most renewable of renewable energy systems</p>

3. The assumed costs were values used for calculations and must not be assumed to apply necessarily to either today or the future. Advancing technologies, economies of scale in manufacture, applicable tax deductions and credits, rebate programs, and the changing global economy can bring large differences in equipment and labor costs. However, the analyses processes used in the example will continue to apply.</p>

4. The example considered a single set of assumptions. A more revealing analysis could use Monte Carlo simulation whereby the value each parameter is allowed to vary randomly within an assumed range and the problem is recalculated. Results from a large number of simulations (e.g., at least 100) can be graphed as a cumulative probability distribution function to show the most probable benefit and the range of possible benefits, with their associated probabilities of occurrence.</p>

5. The assumed cost of the heat exchanger increased monotonically and steadily with size. This will not be the case. Each available thermal storage/heat exchanger unit is likely to be appropriate for several array sizes and the cost will be more of a step function. Additionally, the cost of installation is not likely to remain constant and there may be a quantity discount available as the number of collector units increases.</p>

6. As the electric utility industry moves to time-of-day rate structures, the cost of electrically heating water for domestic use becomes much more difficult to determine. Larger hot water storages may become more attractive, due less to improved solar heating system performance than the ability to heat water using conventional energy at times of lowest cost and storing that water to compensate for days and times of reduced solar capture.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. The design example centered on the economic value of the installed solar collector system. Most people can relate to this metric. An alternative would consider the embodied energy in the solar heating system, the yearly input of energy (as for operating pumps and maintaining the system) and the saved energy, and reach a design decision based on net energy rather than net money.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This is a more complex analysis approach, of course, but life cycle analysis is an established field of knowledge that could apply.</p>

8. The same procedure used in the design example can apply to air-based solar collector systems and water-based systems used for space heating. For space heating analysis, monthly heat loss values must be calculated, based perhaps on local heating degree-day data.</p>
