The free haul distance is given to be 100 yd. From point A to C, all cut material can be used for the fill. The distance between points A to C is 160 yd. This is greater than the free haul distance.<br /> Draw a horizontal line (GH) at a distance of 100 yd as shown in Figure 39.12.<br /> Find the coordinates of points G and H.<br /> Point G = Cumulative cut = 200 yd<span class="tex-text">\(^{3},\)</span> station = 40<br /> Point H = Cumulative cut = 200 yd<span class="tex-text">\(^{3},\)</span> station = 140<br /> Between points G and H, all the cut material has been used for fill purposes. Hence, the contrac-tor cannot charge additional funds for hauling of material in this section of the road (Point G to H is the free haul distance).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Point A to G = not within the free haul distance. Additional cost will incur for hauling material.<br /> Point H to C = not within the free haul distance. Additional cost will incur for hauling material.<br /> Point C to I = Distance is 80 yd (240 âˆ’ 160).<br /> This is less than the free haul distance. Hence, no additional cost will incur for points C to I.<br /> Cut material from I to E is waste.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Overhaul<br /> When soil is moved beyond the free haul distance, it is known as overhaul. The contractor is required to be compensated for overhaul.<br /> Limit of profitable haul (LPH): Soil can be profitably moved from point A to point B. However, if the distance between the two points is larger than the LPH, then it is more profitable to obtain soil from an outside source.<br /> Borrow: Volume of soil obtained from an outside source.<br /> Waste: Volume of soil that has to be discarded.<br /> Hauling: Soil that is cut has to be hauled to fill areas. Small distances can be hauled using doz-ers. Typically, distances closer to a mile are hauled using scrapers. Scrapers may not be economical ofor anything beyond one mile. In such situations, trucks are used. It is the judgment of the site supervisor to decide what machines are to be used for a given project (Figure 39.13). Volume A has to be cut and volume B has to be filled. Small haul distances can be one using dozers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Step 1: Cut the volume of soil A1 and fill volume B1. Hauling can be done using dozers since the<br /> distance is short (Figure 39.14).<br /> L1 is the average transportation distance.<br /> Cut volume A1 and fill volume B1 with that soil<br /> L1 = average transportation distance = distance from center of gravity of A1 to the center of gravity of B1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At the beginning of a cut and fill operation, soil can be moved with dozers. The distance from cut site to fill site would be small.<br /> Step 2: Cut a volume of soil A2 and fill volume B2 with the same soil. (Soil at A2 goes to B2) (Figure 39.15).<br /> Cut volume A2 and fill B2 with that soil. L2 is the average transportation distance from A2 to B2.<br /> One can see that the soil has to be transported longer distances <span class="tex-text">\(L2 \gt L1.\)</span><br /> Depending upon the site conditions, it may not be efficient to use the dozers to move soil.<br /> Hence, scrapers can be utilized.<br /> Step 3: Cut a volume of soil at A3 and fill volume B3 (Figure 39.16).<br /> Cutting occurs from X to Y. Hence, the cutting cumulative volume increases until Y. After Y, the fill begins.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cumulative cut volume increases from point X to Y. The fill starts at point Y. Hence, the mass diagram will start to bend down. Since there is more cut in this section, there is excess soil at the end that needs to be trucked away.<br /> Moving soil volume A3 to B3 involves the transportation of soil for much longer distances. In such situations, trucks may be the most efficient method.<br /> Volume of soil A4 is the surplus. This soil may be cut and transported out of the site.<br /> Most efficient method to conduct a cut and fill operation: Cutting of soil is mostly done using dozers. Sometimes, backhoes may be needed for cutting of soil due to steep slopes or loose soil sit-uations where dozers are unable to access the location. Moving of soil at shorter distances can be done using dozers efficiently. However, dozers become increasingly inefficient when the distance increase. In such situations, scrapers are used to scrape and move soil. One has to understand that<br /> the rental cost of a scraper may be twice as much as a dozer. Trucks are needed for much longer distances. In many situations, trucks may have to use local roads that could have significant traffic. Hence, it is advisable to move the soil early in the morning before the rush hour and then after the rush hour. The foreman of the site has to plan his work in the most efficient manner.</p>

Contour Lines<br /> Contour lines represent elevations.<br /> In Figure 39.17, the contour elevation increases from 100 to 130. This represents a hill. On the other hand, Figure 39.18 represents a lake or a crater.<br /> Cut and fill computations using contour lines<br /> Cut and fill can be computed using contour lines. The following example shows how to compute cut and fill volumes using contour lines.</p>
