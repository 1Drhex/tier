(b) Most businesses operate in more than one industry and more than one geographical market. This makes the traditional statements difficult to interpret because different industrial and geographical sectors will have different prospects and different risk characteristics. IAS 14 attempts to overcome this problem to some extent by requiring that the figures for revenue, results and net assets be broken down by segment. This makes it easier to compare results from one year to the next because readers can see how changes in profitability or capital employed have come about in terms of the different segments. It will also make it easier to compare the results between entities because different businesses will be composed differently. Segmental information might, therefore, be easier to compare between businesses.<br /> Unfortunately, there are major costs associated with publishing segmental information. It is likely to be used by competitors to identify potential lucrative markets or opportunities. If entities provide too much useful information they might actually cost their shareholders a considerable amount in terms of profits lost due to additional competition. This creates some pressure to restrict the amount of useful material published. This can be seen in the nature of the disclosures provided above. For example, most readers would prefer a two dimensional analysis of revenue, profit and net assets.<br /> Revenue Electroniccomponents Software Systems Total<br /> . $000 $000 $000 $000<br /> Europe A B C 352,450<br /> America D E F 317,205<br /> Other G H I 35,245</p>
 <p class="blog">
Total 255,000 193,000 256,900 704,900<br /> This presentation would involve analysing the totals to show, say, revenue from electronic components in Europe in cell A, from America in D and so on. While that information would be useful, it is rarely if ever disclosed because of the commercial sensitivity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are further problems of a more technical nature. It is difficult to adequately define segments. In the case of Emm we have broken everything down between three industrial segments. It may, however, be possible to argue that the entity produces different categories of electronic components and that these figures ought to be broken down between two or more further segments. Similarly, it could be argued that geographical analyses by continent are too broad and that American and European figures should be analysed further.<br /> Segmental reporting also creates problems of common costs and assets, for example, the cost of running the head office function and the assets used in the head office itself. In the case of Emm, we appear to have apportioned them to our main segments. Some businesses treat such common items as a separate element of the analysis and show a total before common costs or assets. This difference creates problems when it is necessary to compare segmental information between entities.</p>
