            <p class="blog">Advertising Selection with Nonlinear Response Functions</p> <p class="blog">I n this example, we revisit the problem faced by the General Flakes Company in  of Chapter 4. The company must decide how many ads to place on each of several television shows to meet exposure constraints for each of six groups of custom-ers. (Refer to Figure 7.31 and the file Advertising Selection.xlsx for the specific inputs.) The difference now is that each combination of television show and customer group has its own advertising response function of the form in Equation (7.4). That is, there are constants a and b of the response function for each such combination. (These constants appear in rows 5 to 10 and 14 to 19 of the file.) The company wants to find the selection of ads that minimizes its total cost of meeting all exposure requirements.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span class="tex-text">\(f(n) = a(1 - e^{-bn})\)</span> (7.4)</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use a nonlinear model to find a minimum-cost way of meeting all exposure requirements.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> We already discussed where many of the inputs come from in  of Chapter 4. The new inputs, the parameters of the various response functions, come from fitting response functions, exactly as in the previous example, for each combination of television show and customer group. Of course, this assumes the company has enough historical data to carry out this procedure. The numbers used here are for illustration only, although they are reasonable.</p>

The variables and constraints for this model are shown in Figure 7.30. (See the file Advertising Selection Big Picture.xlsx.) Except for the new inputs from the advertising response functions, this is exactly like the “big picture” for  of Chapter 4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 7.31 and in the file Advertising Selection Finished.xlsx. The model can be developed with the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the inputs in the light blue cells. These include the parameters of the advertising response functions in rows 5 to 10 and 14 to 19. Again, these inputs would typically be estimated from historical data.<br /> 2) Ads purchased. Enter any trial values of the numbers of ads purchased for the various shows in row 25. These cells become the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Exposures from each show to each group. Use the advertising response functions to calculate the numbers of exposures to each customer group from each show. To do this, enter the formula<br /> =B5*(1-EXP(-B14*B$25))<br /> in cell B29 and copy it to the range B29:I34. Note that row 25 must be kept absolute for copying to work correctly, because the numbers of ads are always in row 25.<br /> 4) Total exposures to each group. Calculate the numbers of exposures to each group by entering the formula<br /> =SUM(B29:I29)<br /> in cell B38 and copying it down to cell B43. This formula sums overexposures from the various television shows.<br /> 5) Total cost. Calculate the total cost of advertising in cell B46 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B21:I21,Number_ads_purchased)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box is straightforward to complete, as illustrated in Figure 7.32. Just remember to check the Non-Negative option, and use the GRG Nonlinear method because of the nonlinear advertising response functions. Note that you could also constrain the decision variable cells to be integers. This would make the model more difficult for Solver to solve, but it would also make the solution more realistic. (However, you can check that it doesn’t change the optimal solution by much.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> First, note that the constants in rows 5 to 10 of the advertising response functions indicate the maximum numbers of exposures possible to each group from each show. The coefficients in rows 14 to 19 indicate how fast the response functions approach these maximum limits:<br /> When one of these coefficients increases, fewer ads are needed to approach the saturation level. Together, these two sets of constants indicate which types of ads are most effective to the various customer groups. Solver uses this information in its intricate algorithm to decide<br /> how many ads to place on each show. Perhaps surprisingly, no ads are placed on “Sunday Night Football,” although many exposures to men under 55 would be achieved from these ads. Evidently these ads are too expensive, and exposures to men in these groups can be achieved with cheaper ads on other shows. Note also that the women in the 36 to 55 group are evidently the bottleneck group. (Check the differences between the two sides of the exposure constraints.) To achieve the required exposures for this group, many more ads are required than are needed to achieve the required exposures to the other groups.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> It can be shown (with calculus) that this model satisfies the conditions necessary to ensure a single local minimum. Therefore, the Solver solution is optimal. If you didn’t know this, however, you could use the Multistart option.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> An interesting sensitivity analysis for this nonlinear model is to see how the optimal cost varies if all of the required exposures change by the same percentage. If you did this in a linear model (and there were no other constraints to worry about), the optimal cost would change by the same percentage due to the proportionality property of linear models. For example, if you increased the right sides of all constraints by 10%, you would expect the optimal cost to increase by 10% in a linear model. However, this is not true in a nonlinear model, as Figure 7.33 indicates. Here you should change the model slightly so that you can vary a single percentage. (See the Sensitivity worksheet in the finished version of the file for details.) The values in column C indicate the percentage increase in total cost for a given percentage increase in total exposures. For example, to obtain a 40% increase in exposures, the total cost must increase by 56.6%. This illustrates in a very real way a consequence of nonlinearity.</p>
