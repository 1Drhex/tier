            <p class="blog">Buying vs. Renting<br /> George recently graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering from a midwest university.<br /> He has accepted a job in Seattle, and he is deciding between renting and buying a home. George’s hobby is model railroading, and he will not move again unless he leaves Seattle for a job elsewhere in the country.<br /> If George buys the house, it will cost him about $5000 in transaction costs at time 0 and another $20,000 when he sells it. His mortgage and lease payments would be about the same, but he has estimated that the lifestyle and tax advantages of ownership are worth about $3600 per year. George’s interest rate is 9%. How many years must George live in Seattle for buying to be more economically attractive?</p>

One approach is to simply try different years. Another is to graph the present worth of buying the home as a function of the number of years it is owned. Trying N equals 1, 10, and 20 years certainly spans the likely ownership periods. George believes 10 to 15 years is more likely.<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(PW_{1}\)</span> = –5000 – 20,000(P/F, 9%, 1) + 3600(P/A, 9%, 1)<br /> = –5000 – 20,000(.9174) + 3600(.9174) = –$20,045<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(PW_{10}\)</span> = –5000 – 20,000(P/F, 9%, 10) + 3600(P/A, 9%, 10)<br /> = –5000 – 20,000(.4224) + 3600(6.418) = $9657<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(PW_{20}\)</span> = –5000 – 20,000(P/F, 9%, 20) + 3600(P/A, 9%, 20)<br /> = –5000 – 20,000(.1784) + 3600(9.129) = $24,296</p>
 <p class="blog">
As shown in Exhibit 17.1, a linear interpolation between 1 year and 10 years suggests that 7.1 years is the breakeven point. In fact, <span class="tex-text">\(PW_{6}\)</span> = –$776 and <span class="tex-text">\(PW_{7}\)</span> = $2178, so the breakeven point is closer to 6 than to 7 years. A dashed line is used for 1 to 10 and 15 to 20 years, since George believes those values are less likely.</p>
