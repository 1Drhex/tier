<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) Table 10.4 shows the after‐tax cash flows in actual dollars. Since we are dealing with cash flows in actual dollars, we need to find the market interest rate (see Section 4.3.3). The market interest rate to use is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">i = 0.15 + 0.05 + (0.15)(0.05) = 20.75%.<br /> PW(20 .75%) = -$122,200 + $46,692(P/F, 20.75%, 1) + &#8230; + $132,974(P/F, 20.75%, 5)<br /> = $60,957.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since PW(20.75%) <span class="tex-text">\(\gt \)</span> 0, the investment is still economically attractive.<br /> (b) If you calculate the rate of return of the project on the basis of actual dollars, it will be 38.77% as shown in Table 10.4 . Since the market interest rate is 20.75%, the project is still justifiable. To find the real (inflation‐free) rate of return, you can use the following relationship from Eq. (4.8):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i = i^{\prime } + \overline{f} +i^{\prime }\overline{f} \)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i^{\prime } = \frac{i &#8211; \overline{f}}{1 + \overline{f}} = \frac{0.3877 &#8211; 0.05}{1 + 0.05}\)</span>= 32.16%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the inflation‐free MARR is 15%, the project also can be justified on the basis of real dollars.</p>

<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> All cash flow elements, except depreciation and interest expenses, are assumed to be in constant dollars. Since income taxes are levied on actual taxable income, we will use the actual‐dollar analysis, which requires that all cash flow elements be expressed in actual dollars. We make the following observations:<br /> • For the purposes of this illustration, all inflationary calculations are made as of year-end.<br /> • Cash flow elements such as sales, labor, material, overhead, and selling price of the asset will be inflated at the general inflation rate. For example, whereas annual sales had been estimated at $175,000, under conditions of inflation they become 5% higher in year 1 (or $183,750), 10.25% higher in year 2 ($192,938), and so forth.<br /> • Future cash flows in actual dollars for other elements can be obtained in a similar way.<br /> • No change occurs in the investment in year 0 or in the depreciation and interest expenses, since these items are unaffected by expected future inflation.<br /> • Investment in working capital will change with inflation. Working‐capital levels can be maintained only by an additional infusion of cash. For example, the $25,000 investment in working capital made in year 0 will be recovered at the end of the first year, assuming a one‐year recovery cycle. However, because of 5% inflation, the required working capital for the second year increases to $26,250. Thus, in addition to reinvesting the $25,000 recovered at the end of year 1, $1,250 worth of new cash must be made. The $26,250 will be recovered at the end of the second year. However, the project will need a 5% increase in working capital, or $27,563, for the third year, and so forth. The deficit amount must be financed at the beginning of each year. Eventually, no investment in working capital is required in year 5, as the project terminates. Therefore, the firm recovers all the investments it made in working capital in a lump sum ($30,338) at the end of year 5, and it can use this fund for other purposes.</p>

• The depreciation expense is a charge against taxable income, which reduces the amount of taxes paid and, as a result, increases the cash flow attributable to an investment by the amount of taxes saved. But the depreciation expense under existing tax laws is based on historic cost. As time goes by, the depreciation expense is charged to taxable income in dollars of declining purchasing power; as a result, the “real” cost of the asset is not totally reflected in the depreciation expense. Depreciation costs are thereby understated, and the taxable income is thus overstated, resulting in higher taxes.<br /> • On the other hand, the debt payment schedule with a fixed‐interest rate is not going to change as the lender experiences inflation. Therefore, you are paying back with cheaper dollars, resulting in higher profitability. In our example, the increase in profit due to debt financing is smaller than the increase in taxes paid plus additional cash required to maintain proper working capital, so we still see overall loss in NPW.<br /> • The resale price of the asset is expected to increase at the general inflation rate. Therefore, the salvage value in actual dollars will be</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">$45,000(1 + 0.05)<span class="tex-text">\(^{5}\)</span> = $57,433.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This increase in salvage value will also increase the taxable gains, as the book value remains unchanged. The calculations for both the book value and gains tax are shown in Table 10.4 .<br /> • Note that the PW in the absence of inflation was $63,816 in Example 10.5.The $2,859 decrease (known as inflation loss) in the PW under inflation, illustrated in this example, is due entirely to income‐tax considerations and working‐capital drains.</p>
