The space between the bottom of the footing and the surface will be occupied partly by concrete (footing, concrete floor) and partly by backfill. An average unit weight of 125 pcf can be assumed. Hence, the effective portion of the allowable bearing pressure that is available for carrying the column loads is <span class="tex-text">\(q_e = q_a −\)</span> (weight of fill and concrete + surcharge) = <span class="tex-text">\(6000 − (6 \times 125 + 100)\)</span> = 5150 psf. Then the required area <span class="tex-text">\(A_{req}\)</span> = sum of column loads/<span class="tex-text">\(q_e = 750/5.15 = 145.5 ft^2\)</span>. The resultant of the column loads is located from the center of the exterior column a distance <span class="tex-text">\(450 \times 18/750\)</span> = 10.8 ft. Hence, the length of the footing must be 2(10.8 + 0.75) = 23.1 ft. A length of 23 ft 3 in. is selected. The required width is then 145.5/23.25 = 6.3 ft. A width of 6 ft 6 in. is selected (see Fig. 15.16).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Longitudinally, the footing represents a beam, loaded from below, spanning between columns and cantilevering beyond the interior column. Since this beam is considerably wider than the columns, the column loads are distributed crosswise by transverse beams, one under each column. In the present relatively narrow and long footing, it will be found that the required minimum depth for the transverse beams is smaller than is required for the footing in the longitudinal direction. These “beams,” therefore, are not really distinct members but merely represent transverse strips in the main body of the footing, reinforced so that they are capable of resisting the transverse bending moments and the corresponding shears. It then becomes necessary to decide how large the effective width of this transverse beam can be assumed to be. Obviously, the strip directly under the column does not deflect independently and is strengthened by the adjacent parts of the footing. The effective width of the transverse beams is therefore evidently larger than that of the column. In the absence of definite rules for this case, or of research results on which to base such rules, the authors recommend conservatively that the load be assumed to spread outward from the column into the footing at a slope of 2 vertical to 1 horizontal. This means that the effective width of the transverse beam is assumed to be equal to the width of the column plus d/2 on either side of the column, d being the effective depth of the footing.</p>

<strong>Strength design in longitudinal direction</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The net upward pressure caused by the factored column loads is<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(q_u = \frac{1.2(170 + 250) + 1.6(130 + 200)}{23.25 \times 6.5} = 6.83 kips/ft^2\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Then the net upward pressure per linear foot in the longitudinal direction is <span class="tex-text">\(6.83 \times 6.5\)</span> = 44.4 kips/ft. The maximum negative moment between the columns occurs at the section of zero shear. Let x be the distance from the outer edge of the exterior column to this section. Then (see Fig. 15.17)</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(V_u = 44,400 x − 412,000 = 0\)</span> <p class="blog">
results in x = 9.28 ft. The moment at this section is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_u=\left[44,400\frac{9.28^2}{2}-412,000(9.28-0.75) \right]12= − 19,230,000\)</span> in-lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
The moment at the right edge of the interior column is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_u=44,400\left(\frac{3.5^2}{2} \right)12= 3,260,000\)</span> in-lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the details of the moment diagram are as shown in Fig. 15.17. Try d = 37.5 in. From the shear diagram in Fig. 15.17, it is seen that the critical section for flexural shear occurs at a distance d to the left of the left face of the interior column. At that point, the factored shear is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_u = 376,000 − \frac{37.5}{12}(44,400) = 237,000\)</span> lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the design shear strength<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(ϕ V_c = ϕ 2 λ \sqrt{f_c^\prime} bd = 0.75 \times 2 \times 1 \sqrt{3000} \times 78 \times 37.5 = 240,000 lb \gt V_u\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
indicating that d = 37.5 in. is adequate.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Additionally, as in single footings, punching shear should be checked on a perimeter section a distance d/2 around the column, on which the nominal shear stress <span class="tex-text">\(v_c = 4 \times 1 \sqrt{3000} = 220\)</span> psi. Of the two columns, the exterior one with a three-sided perimeter a distance d/2 from the column is more critical in regard to this punching shear. The perimeter is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(b_o=2\left(1.5+\frac{37.5/12}{2} \right)+\left(2.0+\frac{37.5}{12} \right)=11.25\)</span> ft</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the shear force, being the column load minus the soil pressure within the perimeter, is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(V_u = 412,000 − 3.06 \times 5.12(6830)\)</span> = 305,000 lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
On the other hand, the design shear strength on the perimeter section is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(ϕ V_c = ϕ v_c b_o d = 0.75 \times 220 \times 11.25 \times 12 \times 37.5\)</span> = 835,000 lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
considerably larger than the factored shear <span class="tex-text">\(V_u\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
With d = 37.5 in., and with 3.5 in. cover from the center of the bars to the top surface of the footing, the total thickness is 41 in.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To determine the required steel area, <span class="tex-text">\(M_u / ϕ bd^2 = 19,230,000/(0.9 \times 78 \times 37.5^2 ) = 195\)</span> is used to enter Graph A.1b of Appendix A. For this value, the curve 60/3 gives the reinforcement ratio <span class="tex-text">\(ρ = 0.0035\)</span>. The required steel area is <span class="tex-text">\(A_s = 0.0035 \times 37.5 \times 78 = 10.3 in^2\)</span>. Eleven No. 9 (No. 29) bars furnish 11.00 <span class="tex-text">\(in^2\)</span>. The required development length is found to be 6.7 ft. From Fig. 15.17, the distance from the point of maximum moment to the nearer left end of the bars is seen to be <span class="tex-text">\(9.30 &#8211; \frac{3}{12}\)</span> = 9.05 ft, much larger than the required minimum development length. The selected reinforcement is therefore adequate for both bending and bond.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the portion of the longitudinal beam that cantilevers beyond the interior column, the minimum required steel area controls. Here,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_{s, min} = \frac{3 \sqrt{f_c^\prime}}{f_y}bd = \frac{3 \sqrt{3000}}{60,000} \times 78 \times 37.5 = 8.01 in^2\)</span> <p class="blog">
but not less than</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_{s , min} = \frac{200}{f_y}bd = \frac{200}{60,000} \times 78 \times 37.5 = 9.75 in^2\)</span> <p class="blog">
Sixteen No. 7 (No. 22) bars with <span class="tex-text">\(A_s = 9.62 in^2\)</span> are selected; their development length is computed and for bottom bars is found satisfactory.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Design of transverse beam under interior column</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The width of the transverse beam under the interior column can now be established as previously suggested and is <span class="tex-text">\(24 + 2( d/2) = 24 + 2 \times 18.75 = 61.5\)</span> in. The net upward load per linear foot of the transverse beam is 620,000/6.5 = 95,400 lb/ft. The moment at the edge of the interior column is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(M_u=95,400\left(\frac{2.25^2}{2} \right)12=2,900,000\)</span> in-lb</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the transverse bars are placed on top of the longitudinal bars (see Fig. 15.16), the actual value of d furnished is 37.5 – 1.0 = 36.5 in. The minimum required steel area controls; that is,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(A_s = \frac{200}{60,000} 61.5 \times 36.5 = 7.48 in^2\)</span> <p class="blog">
Thirteen No. 7 (No. 22) bars are selected and placed within the 61.5 in. effective width of the transverse beam.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Punching shear at the perimeter a distance d/2 from the column has been checked before. The critical section for regular flexural shear, at a distance d from the face of the column, lies beyond the edge of the footing, and therefore no further check on shear is needed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The design of the transverse beam under the exterior column is the same as the design of that under the interior column, except that the effective width is 36.75 in. The details of the calculations are not shown. It can be easily checked that eight No. 7 (No. 22) bars, placed within the 36.75 in. effective width, satisfy all requirements. Design details are shown in Fig. 15.16.</p>
