Let us first look at the FBD of the two-beam structure as a whole, which is shown in Figure 10-26. The external forces acting on this structure are the support forces at the hinge at points A and B and the weights of the two beams. We do not consider the force acting on the hinge at C because this force is internal to the system. The FBD for an object or a system shows only the external forces acting on it.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Examine Figure 10-26. Do you spot any issues with the FBD? We have obviously made an incorrect assumption about the direction of one of the horizontal components of the support forces at the hinges. They cannot both point in the same direction! As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, we do that here intentionally for illustration purposes to explore how we deal with an incorrect assumption about the direction of an unknown force and the negative value we will obtain in that case.</p>
 <p class="blog">
With some careful examination, we can perhaps already guess that the horizontal component of the support force at A should point to the right, which it does in our diagram. This can be seen by taking the torques about point B. It is perhaps also relatively easy to see that the vertical component of the support force at A must point up, which, again, it does in our diagram. This is not as evident or clear as in the case for the vertical component of the support force at B. Although with some reasoning one can arrive at the correct guess for the direction, it is advisable in many applications not to spend the time on figuring out the direction of the unknown force but simply to go with a guess and finish the solution efficiently and quickly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The forces that exert torques about point B in Figure 10-26 are the weights of the beams, <span class="tex-text">\(m_{1} \overrightarrow{ g } \text { and } m_{2} \overrightarrow{ g }\)</span> , as well as <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x}\)</span>, the horizontal component of the support force at the hinge at A. The components of the force at the hinge at <span class="tex-text">\(B, B_{x} \text { and } B_{y}\)</span>, exert no torque about B because the moment arm of these components about B is zero, since their lines of action pass through the pivot at B. The vertical component of the support for the hinge at A also exerts no torque about point B because the line of action of this component passes through the hinge at B; therefore, the moment arm for <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span> about B is also zero. So, the sum of the torques about point B is</p>

&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\sum \vec{\tau}_{ B }=\vec{\tau}_{m_{1} g}+\vec{\tau}_{m_{2} g}+\vec{\tau}_{A_{x}}=0\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Taking clockwise to be positive, the torques of <span class="tex-text">\(m_{1} \overrightarrow{ g } \text { and } m_{2} \overrightarrow{ g }\)</span> are both positive, and the torque of <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x}\)</span> is negative. Thus,</p>

 <p class="blog">
From Figure 10-26, the perpendicular distances from the pivot at B to <span class="tex-text">\(m_{1} \overrightarrow{ g } \text { and } m_{2} \overrightarrow{ g }\)</span> are 1.50 m and 4.00 m, respectively. Therefore,</p>

 <p class="blog">
We can now immediately determine another unknown by summing the forces in the x direction. The only forces acting in the x direction are the horizontal components of the hinge forces at A and B, <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x} \text { and } B_{x}\)</span>. Therefore,</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(B_{x}=-A_{x}=-39.4 kN\)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The negative value for <span class="tex-text">\(B_{x}\)</span> indicates that it points in the direction opposite to what we drew in the FBD. However, in subsequent calculations we simply use the negative value we obtained for <span class="tex-text">\(B_{x}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
No other unknown can be found by looking at the entire two-beam structure as one body, so we now apply the conditions for equilibrium to the components of the structure. We still need to find the vertical components of the forces at hinges A and B, as well as the forces acting on the hinge at C.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We now draw the FBD for each beam (Figure 10-27). The forces acting on the long beam are its weight, the horizontal and vertical components of the hinge force at B, <span class="tex-text">\(B_{x} \text { and } B_{y}\)</span>, and the force acting on the hinge at C. Since we do not know the direction of the force at C, we make the assumptions shown in Figure 10-27 for the horizontal and vertical components of that force. We call the forces acting on the top beam at <span class="tex-text">\(C, C_{x} \text { and } C_{y}\)</span>, and the forces acting on lower beam at the hinge at <span class="tex-text">\(C , C_{x}^{\prime} \text { and } C_{y}^{\prime}\)</span>. We note here that <span class="tex-text">\(C_{x} \text { and } C_{x}^{\prime}\)</span> are an action-reaction pair, and by Newton’s third law, they have the same magnitude but point in opposite directions. Similarly, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{y} \text { and } C_{y}^{\prime}\)</span> are also an action-reaction pair.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that to illustrate what happens when we make an incorrect assumption about the direction of an unknown force, we have made an absurd assumption that the vertical component of the support force at C acts downward on the top beam. In fact, <span class="tex-text">\(C_{y}\)</span> must be directed upward so it can hold the top beam up. Choosing the incorrect direction will not affect the end result of the analysis.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Summing the torques about B in the FBD for the top beam will yield one of the unknowns. Since the forces that exert torques about B are the weight of the beam <span class="tex-text">\(\left(m \overrightarrow{ g }_{2}\right)\)</span> and the vertical component of the support force at point C,</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
The positive value for the variable <span class="tex-text">\(C_{y}\)</span> means that that our guess for its direction is correct, and it points in the direction drawn on the FBD.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To find the vertical component of the force at the hinge at B, we apply the equilibrium conditions for the vertical forces acting on the top beam. Here, we have the weight of the beam, the vertical component of the force at C, and the vertical component of the force at B. Therefore,</p>

 <p class="blog">
The negative value for the variable By means that our assumption regarding the direction for By in Figure 10-27 was not correct. We must be careful to use this negative value in subsequent calculations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, we find the horizontal component of the force acting on the hinge at <span class="tex-text">\(C, C_{x}\)</span>, by summing the forces acting on the top beam in the x direction. Since the only forces here are the forces at B and C, we have</p>

 <span class="tex-text">\(C_{x}=-B_{x}=-(-39.4 kN )=39.4 kN\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that we have used the value of <span class="tex-text">\(B_{x} as -39.4 kN\)</span> as obtained in result (3) above, as we have noted earlier. The positive value for <span class="tex-text">\(C_{x}\)</span> indicates that we guessed the correct direction for <span class="tex-text">\(C_{x}\)</span> in the FBD in Figure 10-27.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now we can go back to the FBD for the entire system. The only unknown we have left is the vertical component of the support force at A. We take the sum of the vertical forces on the entire structure: the weight of the top beam <span class="tex-text">\(\left(m_{2} \overrightarrow{ g }\right)\)</span>, the weight of the bottom beam <span class="tex-text">\(\left(m_{1} \overrightarrow{ g }\right)\)</span>, and the vertical components of the support forces at A and B, <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y} \text { and } B_{y} \text {. }\)</span>.

Note again that we have substituted for the variable <span class="tex-text">\(B_{y}\)</span> the negative value we obtained for it in result (8). We point out that wherever this variable comes up, be it in a force or a torque equation, we use substitute the negative value of the variable in the required equation.</p>

<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>

 <p class="blog">
As we anticipated, one of <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x} \text { or } B_{x}\)</span> had to point opposite to our guess for its direction. We might have guessed it would be <span class="tex-text">\(B_{x}\)</span> since the torques are all trying to rotate the structure in a clockwise direction. However, it is important to once again note that spending any time beforehand trying to guess these directions is unnecessary. You simply need to use a consistent approach and the results will tell you the actual directions of the forces.</p>
