(a) KL appears to be a profitable entity. Preparing a rough estimate of profits from a reverse funds-flow statement shows that it expects to earn around 18 per cent profit before tax and depreciation charges.</p>

Decrease in bank balance (125)<br /> Increase in finished goods 170<br /> Increase in receivables 235 (660 &#8211; 425) +Oct to Dec–Jan to Mar<br /> Increase in payables (102) (231 &#8211; 129) + Oct to Dec–Jan to Mar<br /> Capital expenditure 120<br /> Dividends 100<br /> Taxation (165)<br /> Profit before non-cash items (e.g. depreciation) 463</p>
 <p class="blog">
Turnover is expected to be $1,725,000, that is, ($1,490,000 + $660,000 + $425,000). Profit (before depreciation charges and tax) as a percentage of turnover is 17.8 per cent.<br /> (b) The entity’s existing overdraft facility is clearly inadequate to cover the months of July to November. The entity is starting 20X7 with an overdraft of $75,000 as compared with a positive balance of $50,000 at the beginning of 20X6. If further capital expenditure is planned in 20X7 and dividends continue at a similar level, the problem will arise again even earlier in 20X7. Suppliers’ costs also seem to have risen (30 per cent of sales until September when it increases to 35 per cent), but sales prices have been held steady.<br /> A number of measures are possible to reduce the cash requirement mid-year, and possibly into 20X7.<br /> 1. Reduce or defer the dividend. If this is not acceptable to the shareholders there is little they can do about it. Shares in unlisted entities are difficult to trade, particularly when the entity has just cut its dividend.<br /> 2. Defer paying the tax, with the agreement of the tax authority. This would involve interest charges, but they might be less than the bank’s.<br /> 3. Investigate the build-up of inventory. This may well be in anticipation of sales growth, but an investigation into inventory control methods might be useful.<br /> 4. Review terms of trade with both customers and suppliers. These require separate discussion:</p>
 <p class="blog">
(i) Customers are taking on average 30 days longer than they are allowed. This is typical in the UK. KL could consider introducing discounts for prompt payment, although these usually work out expensive if they are high enough to be effective and often customers take the discount, even if they pay late.<br /> (ii) KL may be forgoing discounts for early payment by paying its debts so late. If it paid on time the cash deficit would be worse, as the entity gives two months to customers but is allowed, officially, only six weeks from suppliers.<br /> 5. If this inequality between terms of trade cannot be resolved, by either reducing credit terms to customers or negotiating longer terms from suppliers, KL could consider factoring its debts. However, this is a policy decision that should not be taken as a short-term solution.<br /> 6. Defer capital expenditure, particularly on motor vehicles unless they are so old it would not be cost-effective. The expenditure on plant and buildings may be necessary for the sales growth. Plant and machinery could perhaps be leased.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. If the premises KL rents out are unwanted, they could perhaps be sold to bring cash into the business, but again this is a long-term solution.<br /> 8. Existing assets could be sold and leased back.<br /> 9. Review the production process. Producing evenly throughout the year for a seasonal business is unusual, although there are arguments in favour of such methods.<br /> 10. Some services, possibly even production, could be outsourced.<br /> 11. Medium- or long-term finance such as bank loans, debt or equity from shareholders could be sought.<br /> 12. Part of the business could be sold or assistance sought from a venture capital entity, although effect on ownership may be a consideration here.</p>
