            <p class="blog">Using @RISK at Walton Bookstore<br /> Recall that Walton Bookstore buys calendars for $7.50, sells them at the regular price of $10, and gets a refund of $2.50 for all calendars that cannot be sold. In contrast to , we assume now that Walton estimates a triangular probability distribution for demand, where the minimum, most likely, and maximum values of demand are 100, 175, and 300, respectively. The company wants to use this probability distribution, together with @RISK, to simulate the profit for any particular order quantity, with the ultimate goal of finding the best order quantity.<br /> <strong>Objective</strong> To learn about @RISK’s basic functionality by revisiting the Walton Bookstore problem.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The monetary values are the same as before. The parameters of the triangular distribution of demand are probably Walton’s best subjective estimates, possibly guided by its experience with previous calendars. As in many simulation examples, the triangular distribution has been chosen for simplicity. In this case, the manager would need to estimate only three quantities: the minimum possible demand, the maximum possible demand, and the most likely demand.</p>

We use this example to illustrate important features of @RISK. We first show how it helps you to implement an appropriate input probability distribution for demand. Then we show how it can be used to build a simulation model for a specific order quantity and generate outputs from this model. Finally, we show how the RISKSIMTABLE function enables you to simultaneously generate outputs from several order quantities so that you can compare order quantities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Simulation Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model for profit is essentially the same model developed previously without @RISK, as shown in Figure 10.32. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; @RISK Finished.xlsx.) There are only a few new things to be aware of.<br /> 1) Input distribution. To generate a random demand, enter the formula<br /> =ROUND(RISKTRIANG(E4,E5,E6),0)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B13 for the random demand. This uses the RISKTRIANG function to generate a demand from the triangular distribution. (As before, our convention is to color random input cells green.) Excel’s ROUND function is used to round demand to the nearest integer. Recall from the discussion in section 10.3 that Excel has no built-in functions to generate random numbers from a triangular distribution, but this is easy with @RISK.<br /> 2) Output cell. When the simulation runs, you want @RISK to keep track of profit. In @RISK’s terminology, you need to designate the Profit cell, F13, as an output cell. To do this, select cell F13 and then click the Add Output button on the @RISK ribbon. (See Figure 10.31.) This adds RISKOUTPUT(&#8220;label&#8221;)1 to the cell’s formula. (Here, “label” is a label that @RISK uses for its reports. In this case it makes sense to use “Profit” as the label. If “label” is left blank, @RISK uses an adjacent label in its reports.) The formula in cell F13 changes from<br /> =C13+E13-D13<br /> to<br /> =RISKOUTPUT(&#8220;Profit&#8221;)+C13+E13-D13<br /> The plus sign following RISKOUTPUT does not indicate addition. It is simply @RISK’s way of indicating that you want to keep track of the value in this cell (for reporting reasons) as the simulation progresses. Any number of cells can be designated in this way as output cells. They are typically the “bottom line” values of primary interest. Our convention is to color such cells gray for emphasis<span class="tex-text">\(.^{9}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Statistic functions (optional). There are several places where you can store @RISK results. One of these is to use @RISK statistic functions to place results in your model worksheet. @RISK provides several functions for summarizing output values. Some of these are illustrated in the range B16:B23 of Figure 10.32. They contain the formulas</p>
 <p class="blog">
=RISKMIN(F13)<br /> =RISKMAX(F13)<br /> =RISKMEAN(F13)<br /> =RISKSTDDEV(F13)<br /> =RISKPERCENTILE(F13,0.05)<br /> =RISKPERCENTILE(F13,0.95)<br /> =RISKTARGET(F13,300)<br /> and<br /> =1-RISKTARGET(F13,400)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The values in these cells are not meaningful until you run the simulation (so do not be alarmed if they contain error symbols when you open the file). However, once the simulation runs, these formulas capture summary statistics of profit. For example, RISKMEAN calculates the average of the 1000 simulated profits, RISKPERCENTILE finds the value such that the specified percentage of simulated profits are less than or equal to this value, and RISKTARGET finds the percentage of simulated profits less than or equal to the specified value. Although these same summary statistics also appear in other @RISK reports, you might like to have them in the same worksheet as the model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Running the Simulation</strong><br /> After you develop the model, the rest is straightforward. The procedure is always the same: (1) specify simulation settings, (2) run the simulation, and (3) examine the results.<br /> 1) Simulation settings. You must first choose some simulation settings. To do so, the buttons in the Simulation group (see Figure 10.33) are useful. We typically do the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ Set Iterations to a number such as 1000. (@RISK calls replications “iterations.”) Any number can be used, but because the academic version of @RISK allows only 1000 uninterrupted iterations, we typically choose 1000.<br /> ■ Set Simulations to 1. In a later section, we will explain why you might want to request multiple simulations.<br /> ■ Click the “dice” button so that it becomes colored. This button is actually a toggle for what appears in your worksheet. If it is colored, the setting is called “Random” and all random cells appear random (they change when you press the F9 key). If it is white, the “static” setting, only the means appear in random input cells and the F9 key has no effect. You can decide which setting you prefer, but this setting is irrelevant when you run the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ When you run a simulation, a graph of some input or output might automatically appear. If you don’t want this behavior, you can toggle the button to the right of the “dice” button so that it is not colored. You can always get the graphs you want later on.<br /> ■ Many more settings are available by clicking the Settings button to the left of the “dice” button, but the ones we mentioned should suffice. In addition, more permanent settings can be chosen from Application Settings under Utilities on the @RISK ribbon. You can experiment with these, but the only one we like to change is the Place Reports In setting. The default is to place reports in a new workbook. If you like the reports to be in the same workbook as your model, you can change this setting to Active Workbook.</p>
 <p class="blog">
@<strong>RISK TECHNICAL ISSUES</strong>: Latin Hypercube Sampling and Mersenne Twister Generator<br /> Two settings you shouldn’t change are the Sampling Type and Generator settings (available from the button to the left of the “dice” button and then the Sampling tab). They should remain at the default Latin Hypercube and Mersenne Twister settings. The Mersenne Twister is one algorithm, of many, for generating random numbers, and it has been shown to have very good statistical properties. (Not all random number generators do.) Latin Hypercube sampling is a more efficient way of sampling than the other option (Monte Carlo) because it produces a more accurate estimate of the output distribution. In fact, it is surprising how muchmore accurate it can be in some models. In repeated runs of this model, for example, always using different random numbers, we virtually always got a mean profit within a few pennies of $337.50. It turns out that this is the true mean profit for this input distribution of demand. Amazingly, simulation estimates it correctly—almost exactly—on virtually every run. Unfortunately, this means that a confidence interval for the mean, based on @RISK’s outputs and the usual confidence interval formula (which assumes Monte Carlo sampling), is much wider (more pessimistic) than it should be. Therefore, we do not even calculate such confidence intervals from here on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Run the simulation. To run the simulation, simply click the Start Simulation in Figure 10.33. When you do so, @RISK repeatedly generates a random number for each random input cell, recalculates the worksheet, and keeps track of all output cell values. You can watch the progress at the bottom left of the screen.<br /> 3) Examine the results. The big questions are (1) which results you want and (2) where you want them. @RISK provides a lot of possibilities, and we mention the ones you will probably use.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ You can ask for summary measures in your model worksheet by using the @RISK statistic functions, such as RISKMEAN, discussed earlier.<br /> ■ The quickest way to get results is to select an input or output cell (we chose the profit cell, F13) and then click on the Browse Results button on the @RISK ribbon. (See Figure 10.34.) This provides an interactive histogram of the selected value, as shown in Figure 10.35. You can move the sliders on this histogram to see probabilities of various outcomes. Note that the window you see from Browse Results is temporary—<br /> it goes away when you click the Close (upper right X) button. You can make a permanent copy of the chart by clicking the second button from the left (see the bottom of Figure 10.35) and choosing one of the copy options.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong>: Graph Options<br /> When we displayed the graph in Figure 10.35 the first time, it had the right slider on 500 but showed 5% to the right of it. By default, @RISK puts the sliders at the 5th and 95th percentiles, so that 5% is on either side of them. For this example, 500 is indeed the 95th percentile (why?), but the picture is a bit misleading because there is no chance of a profit greater than 500. When we manually moved the right slider away from 500 and back again, it displayed as in Figure 10.35, correctly indicating that there is no probability to the right of 500. Also, if your graph has a lot of skinny bars, you can click the fourth button from the bottom left and select Probability Density.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Tip</strong>: Saving Results and Graphs<br /> When you run a simulation with @RISK and then save your file, it asks whether you want to save your results and graphs. If you do so, your file will be slightly larger, but when you reopen it, the results and graphs, such as the histogram in Figure 10.35, will still be available. Otherwise, you will have to rerun the simulation.</p>
 <p class="blog">
■ You can click the Summary button (again, see Figure 10.34) to see the temporary window in Figure 10.36 with the summary measures for Profit. In general, this report shows the summary for all designated inputs and outputs. By default, this Results Summary window shows a mini histogram for each output and a number of numerical summary measures. However, it is easy to customize. If you right-click anywhere in this table and choose Columns for Table, you can check or uncheck any of the options. For most of the later screenshots in this book, we elected not to show the Errors columns, but instead to show median and standard deviation columns.<br /> ■ You can click the Excel Reports button (again, see Figure 10.34) to choose from a number of reports that are placed in a new workbook or in new worksheets. This is a good option if you want permanent (but non-interactive) copies of reports in your workbook. As an example, Figure 10.37 shows part of the Quick Reports option you can request. It has the same information as the summary report in Figure 10.36, plus a lot more.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Simulation Results</strong><br /> The strength of @RISK is that it keeps track of any outputs you designate and then allows you to show the corresponding results as graphs or tables, in temporary windows or in permanent worksheets. As you have seen, @RISK provides several options for displaying results, and we encourage you to explore the possibilities. However, don’t lose sight of the overall goal: to see how outputs vary as random inputs vary, and to generate reports that tell the story most effectively. For this particular example, the results in Figures 10.32, 10.35, 10.36, and 10.37 allow you to conclude the following:<br /> ■ The smallest simulated profit (out of 1000) was 2$227.50, the largest was $500, the average was $337.48, and the standard deviation of the 1000 profits was $189.07. Of all simulated profits, 5% were 2$47.50 or below, 95% were $500 or above, 36.0% were less than or equal to $300, and 51.5% were larger than $400. (See Figure 10.32. These results are also available from other reports if you request them.)<br /> ■ The profit distribution for this particular order quantity is extremely skewed to the left, with a large bar at $500. (See Figure 10.35.) Do you see why? It is because profit is exactly $500 if demand is greater than or equal to the order quantity, 200. In other words, the probability that profit is $500 equals the probability that demand is at least 200. Lower demands result in decreasing profits, which explains the gradual decline in the histogram from right to left.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using RISKSIMTABLE</strong><br /> Walton’s ultimate goal is to choose an order quantity that provides a large average profit. You could rerun the simulation model several times, each time with a different order quantity in the order quantity cell, and compare the results. However, this has two drawbacks. First, it takes a lot of time and work. The second drawback is more subtle. Each time you run the simulation, you get a different set of random demands. Therefore, one of the order quantities could win the contest just by luck. For a fairer comparison, it is better to test each order quantity on the same set of random demands.<br /> The RISKSIMTABLE function in @RISK enables you to obtain a fair comparison quickly and easily. This function is illustrated in Figure 10.38. (See the file Ordering Calendars &#8211; RiskSimtable Finished.xlsx.) There are two modifications to the previous model. First, the order quantities to test are listed in row 9. (We chose these as representative order quantities. You could change, or add to, this list.) Second, instead of entering a number in cell B9, you enter the formula<br /> =RISKSIMTABLE(D9:H9)<br /> Note that the list does not need to be entered in the spreadsheet (although it is a good idea to do so). You could instead enter the formula<br /> =RISKSIMTABLE({150,175,200,225,250})<br /> where the list of numbers must be enclosed in curly brackets. In either case, the worksheet displays the first member of the list, 150, and the corresponding calculations for this first order quantity. However, the model is now set up to run the simulation for all order quantities in the list.<br /> To implement this, only one setting needs to be changed. As before, enter 1000 for the number of iterations, but also enter 5 for the number of simulations. @RISK then runs five simulations of 1000 iterations each, one simulation for each order quantity in the list, and it uses the same 1000 random demands for each simulation. This provides a fair comparison.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>@RISK Function</strong>: RISKSIMTABLE<br /> To run several simulations all at once, enter the formula =RISKSIMTABLE(list) in any cell. Here, list refers to the list of the values to be simulated, such as various order quantities. Before running the simulation, make sure the number of simulations is set to the number of values in the list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can again get results from the simulation in various ways. Here are some possibilities.<br /> ■ You can enter the same @RISK statistic functions in cells in the model worksheet, as shown in rows 18–23 of Figure 10.38. The trick is to realize that each such function has an optional last argument that specifies the simulation number. For example, the formulas in cells C20 and C22 are =RISKMEAN(Profit,C16)<br /> and<br /> =RISKPERCENTILE(Profit,0.05,C16)<br /> Remember that the results in these cells are meaningless (or show up as errors) until you run the simulation.<br /> ■ You can select the profit cell and click the Browse Results button to see a histogram of profits, as shown in Figure 10.39. By default, the histogram shown is for the first simulation, where the order quantity is 150. However, if you click the red histogram button with the pound sign, you can select any of the simulations. As an example, Figure 10.40 shows the histogram of profits for the fifth simulation, where the order quantity is 250. (Do you see why these two histograms are so different?<br /> When the order quantity is 150, there is a high probability of selling out; hence the spike on the right is large. But the probability of selling out with an order quantity of 250 is much lower, so its spike on the right is much less dominant.)</p>

■ You can click the Summary button to get the results from all simulations shown in<br /> Figure 10.41.<br /> ■ You can click the Excel Reports button to get any of a number of reports on permanent<br /> worksheets. Specifically, Quick Reports is a good choice. This produces several<br /> graphs and summary measures for each simulation, each on a different worksheet.<br /> This provides a lot of information with almost no work!</p>

For this particular example, the results in Figures 10.38–10.41 are illuminating. You can see that an order quantity of 175 provides the largest mean profit. However, is this necessarily the optimal order quantity? This depends on the company’s attitude toward risk. Certainly, larger order quantities incur more risk (their histograms are more spread out, their 5th and 95th percentiles are more extreme), but they also have more upside potential.</p>

On the other hand, a smaller order quantity, while having a somewhat smaller mean, might be preferable because of less variability. It is not an obvious choice, but at least the simulation results provide plenty of information for making the decision.</p>

9:Actually, if you want to get technical, the plus sign does indicate addition. It turns out that the RISKOUTPUT function returns the value 0.</p>
