You know that you can always buy a used car for $8,000 that gets 20 miles to the gallon. A gallon of gas costs $2 and you drive 6,000 miles a year. If the interest rate is 5% and you are interested only in saving money, should you buy a car now rather than wait until your current car dies? Would you make the same decision if you faced a 10% interest rate?</p>

Currently, you are buying 600 gallons of gas at a cost of $1,200 per year. With a more gas-efficient car, you would spend only $600 per year, saving $600 per year in gas payments. If we assume that these payments are made at the end of each year,the present value of these savings for five years is $2,580 at a 5% annual interest rate and $2,280 at 10%. The present value of the amount you must spend to buy the car in five years is $6,240 at 5% and $4,960 at 10%.Thus, the present value of the additional cost of buying now rather than later is $1,760 ( = $8,000 &#8211; $6,240) at 5% and $3,040 at 10%. The benefit from buying now is the present value of the reduced gas payments. The cost is the present value of the additional cost of buying the car sooner rather than later. At 5%, the benefit is $2,580 and the cost is $1,760, so you should buy now. However, at 10%, the benefit, $2,280, is less than the cost, $3,040, so you should buy later.</p>
