            <p class="blog">PID Compensation Design for Spacecraft Attitude Control<br /> A simplified design for spacecraft attitude control was presented in Section 6.5; however, here we have a more realistic situation that includes a sensor lag and a disturbing torque. Figure 6.70 defines the system. Design a PID controller to have zero steady-state error to a constant-disturbance torque, a <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> of <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦, \)</span> and as high a bandwidth as is reasonably possible. Also evaluate the pointing errors versus frequency and compare them to the errors that would result if the system is open loop. For a torque disturbance from solar pressure that acts as a sinusoid at the orbital rate (<span class="tex-text">\( ω = 0.001 \text{ rad/sec or }≈100\)</span> -minute period), determine the fractional improvement by the feedback system.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/11/F6.70-768x249.png"></div>

First, let us take care of the steady-state error. For the spacecraft to be at a steady final value, the total input torque, <span class="tex-text">\( T_d + T_c, \)</span> must equal zero. Therefore, if <span class="tex-text">\( T_d ≠ 0, \)</span> then <span class="tex-text">\( T_c = −T_d. \)</span> The only way this can be true with no error(<span class="tex-text">\( e = 0 \)</span> )is for <span class="tex-text">\( D(s) \)</span> to contain an integral term. Hence, including integral control in the compensation will meet the steady-state requirement. This could also be verified mathematically by use of the Final Value Theorem (see Problem 6.47).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The frequency response of the spacecraft and sensor,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( G(s) = \frac{0.9}{s^2} \left( \frac{2}{s + 2} \right) , \)</span> (6.53)</p>
 <p class="blog">
 is shown in Fig. 6.71. The slopes of <span class="tex-text">\( −2 \)</span> (that is, <span class="tex-text">\( −40 \)</span> db per decade) and <span class="tex-text">\( −3 (−60 \)</span> db per decade) show that the system would be unstable for any value of <span class="tex-text">\( K \)</span> if no derivative feedback were used. This is clear because of Bode’s gain–phase relationship, which shows that the phase would be <span class="tex-text">\( −180^◦ \)</span> for the <span class="tex-text">\( −2 \)</span> slope and <span class="tex-text">\( −270^◦ \)</span> for the <span class="tex-text">\( −3 \)</span> slope and which would correspond to a <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> of <span class="tex-text">\( 0^◦ \)</span> or <span class="tex-text">\( −90^◦. \)</span> Therefore, derivative control is required to bring the slope to <span class="tex-text">\( −1 \)</span> at the crossover frequency that was shown in Section 6.5 to be a requirement for stability. The problem now is to pick values for the three parameters in Eq. (6.52) <span class="tex-text">\( —K, T_D, \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( T_I— \)</span> that will satisfy the specifications.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( D(s) = \frac{K}{s} \left[(T_Ds + 1) \left( s + \frac{1}{T_I} \right) \right] , \)</span> (6.52)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The easiest approach is to work first on the phase so that <span class="tex-text">\( PM = 65^◦ \)</span> is achieved at a reasonably high frequency. This can be accomplished primarily by adjusting <span class="tex-text">\( T_D, \)</span> noting that <span class="tex-text">\( T_I \)</span> has a minor effect if sufficiently larger than <span class="tex-text">\( T_D. \)</span> Once the phase is adjusted, we establish the crossover frequency; then we can easily determine the gain <span class="tex-text">\( K.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
We examine the phase of the PID controller in Fig. 6.69 to determine what would happen to the compensated spacecraft system, <span class="tex-text">\( D(s)G(s), \)</span> as <span class="tex-text">\( T_D \)</span> is varied. If <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_{D} ≥ 2 \text{ rad/sec } , \)</span> the phase lead from the PID control would simply cancel the sensor phase lag, and the composite phase would never exceed <span class="tex-text">\( −180^◦, \)</span> an unacceptable situation. If <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D ≤ 0.01, \)</span> the composite phase would approach <span class="tex-text">\( −90^◦ \)</span> for some range of frequencies and would exceed <span class="tex-text">\( −115^◦ \)</span> for an even wider range of frequencies; the latter threshold would provide a <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> of <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦. \)</span> In the compensated phase curve shown in Fig. 6.71, <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D = 0.1, \)</span> which is the largest value of <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D \)</span> that could provide the required <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> of <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦.\)</span> The phase would never cross the <span class="tex-text">\( −115^◦ (65^◦ PM) \)</span> line for any <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D &gt; 0.1. \)</span> For <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D = 0.1, \)</span> the crossover frequency <span class="tex-text">\( ω_c \)</span> that produces the <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦ PM \)</span> is <span class="tex-text">\( 0.5 \text{ rad/sec }. \)</span> For a value of <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D \ll 0.05, \)</span> the phase essentially follows the dotted curve in Fig. 6.71, which indicates that the maximum possible <span class="tex-text">\( ω_c \)</span> is approximately <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \text{ rad/sec } \)</span> and is provided by <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D = 0.05.\)</span> Therefore, <span class="tex-text">\( 0.05 &lt; 1/T_D &lt; 0.1 \)</span> is the only sensible range for <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D; \)</span> anything less than <span class="tex-text">\( 0.05 \)</span> would provide no significant increase in bandwidth, while anything more than <span class="tex-text">\( 0.1 \)</span> could not meet the <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> specification. Although the final choice is somewhat arbitrary, we have chosen <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D = 0.1 \)</span> for our final design.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Our choice for <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_I \)</span> is a factor of <span class="tex-text">\( 20 \)</span> lower than <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D; \)</span> that is, <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_I = 0.005. \)</span> A factor less than <span class="tex-text">\( 20 \)</span> would negatively impact the phase at crossover, thus lowering the <span class="tex-text">\( PM.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Furthermore, it is generally desirable to keep the compensated magnitude as large as possible at frequencies below <span class="tex-text">\( ω_c \)</span> in order to have a faster transient response and smaller errors; maintaining <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_D \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( 1/T_I \)</span> at the highest possible frequencies will bring this about.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The only remaining task is to determine the proportional part of the PID controller, or <span class="tex-text">\( K. \)</span> Unlike the system in , where we selected <span class="tex-text">\( K \)</span> in order to meet a steady-state error specification, here we select a value of <span class="tex-text">\( K \)</span> that will yield a crossover frequency at the point corresponding to the required <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> of <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦. \)</span> The basic procedure for finding <span class="tex-text">\( K, \)</span> discussed in Section 6.6, consists of plotting the compensated system amplitude with <span class="tex-text">\( K = 1,\)</span> finding the amplitude value at crossover, then setting <span class="tex-text">\( 1/K \)</span> equal to that value. Figure 6.71 shows that when <span class="tex-text">\( K = 1, |D(s)G(s)| = 20 \)</span> at the desired crossover frequency <span class="tex-text">\( ω_c = 0.5 \text{ rad/sec}. \)</span> Therefore,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{1}{K} = 20, \text{ so } K = \frac{1}{20} = 0.05. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The compensation equation that satisfies all of the specifications is now complete:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( D(s) = \frac{0.05}{s}[(10s + 1)(s + 0.005)].\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
It is interesting to note that this system would become unstable if the gain were lowered so that <span class="tex-text">\( ω_c ≤ 0.02 \text{ rad/sec }, \)</span> the region in Fig. 6.71 where the phase of the compensated system is less than <span class="tex-text">\( −180^◦. \)</span> As mentioned in Section 6.4, this situation is referred to as a conditionally stable system. A root locus with respect to <span class="tex-text">\( K \)</span> for this and any conditionally stable system would show the portion of the locus corresponding to very low gains in the RHP. The response of the system for a unit step <span class="tex-text">\( θ_{com} \)</span> is shown in Fig. 6.72(a) and exhibits well damped behavior, as should be expected with a <span class="tex-text">\( 65^◦ PM.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The response of the system for a step disturbance torque <span class="tex-text">\( T_d = 0.1 N \)</span> is shown in Fig. 6.72(b). Note that the integral control term does eventually drive the error to zero; however, it is slow due to the presence of a closed-loop pole in the vicinity of the zero at <span class="tex-text">\( s = −0.005. \)</span> Recall from the design process that this zero was located in order that the integral term not impact the <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> unduly. So if the slow disturbance response is not acceptable, speeding up this pole will decrease the <span class="tex-text">\( PM \)</span> and damping of the system. Compromise is often a necessity in control system design!</p>
 <p class="blog">
The frequency response of the error characteristics is shown in Fig. 6.73. The top curve is the open-loop error characteristics and the bottom curve is the closed-loop response. The error is attenuated by almost a factor of <span class="tex-text">\( 10^6 \)</span> by the feedback for a disturbance at the orbital rate; there is decreasing error attenuation as the disturbance frequency increases, and there is almost no error attenuation at the system bandwidth of <span class="tex-text">\( ≈0.5 \text{ rad/sec }, \)</span> as you would expect. Note from the design process that the bandwidth was limited by the response characteristics of the sensor, which had a bandwidth of <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \text{ rad/sec }. \)</span> Therefore, the only way to improve the error characteristics would be to increase the bandwidth of the sensor. On the other hand, increasing the bandwidth of the sensor may introduce jitter from the high-frequency sensor noise. Thus we see the classic trade-off dilemma: the designer has to make a judgment as to which feature (low errors due to disturbances or low errors due to sensor noise) is the more important to the overall system performance.</p>
