It is useful to look first at some numeric summary measures for salary. These are the same summary measures from the previous chapter, but now we want to break them down by position or by one of the other categorical variables. You could do this with Excel formulas, but they are not quite as straightforward as before. If you want to create counts or averages, you can use Excel’s COUNTIF and AVERAGEIF functions. However, there are no MEDIANIF, MINIF, MAXIF, STDEVIF functions or others you might need. Still, there is a way, using array formulas.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results appear in Figure 3.6. This table lists selected summary measures for each of the positions in the data set. A typical formula, the standard deviation for catchers, is shown at the bottom. It uses the STDEV.S function but with an IF function inside. This IF function is essentially a filter on catchers, so the function takes the standard deviation of catcher salaries only. However, this is an array formula, so after you type it, you must press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (all three keys at once). This puts curly brackets around the formula, but you do not actually type these curly brackets. If you want to see salaries broken down by team or any other categorical variable, you can easily run this analysis again with a different categorical variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There are a lot of numbers to digest in Figure 3.6, so it is difficult to get a clear picture of differences across positions. It is more enlightening to see a graphical summary of this information. There are several types of graphs you can use. Our favorite way, discussed shortly, is to create side-by-side box plots. A second possibility is to use pivot tables and corresponding pivot charts, as discussed later in this chapter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Side-by-side box plots are our favorite graphical way of comparing the distribution of a numeric variable across categories of some categorical variable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For now, we illustrate side-by-side box plots. Assuming you have Excel 2016 or later, you can create box plots of Salary by Position. First, select the two columns of data, Position and Salary. Then select a box plot from the Statistical charts list on the Insert ribbon. Excel automatically uses the distinct categories in the Position variable to create a separate box plot for each position. You can interpret each of these box plots as explained in the previous chapter. More importantly, you can compare them.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results appear in Figure 3.7. Now the differences between positions emerge fairly clearly. A few of the conclusions that can be made follow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The salaries for all positions except designated hitter are skewed to the right (mean greater than median, long lines and outliers to the right).</p>
 <p class="blog">
• As a whole, first basemen tend to be the highest paid players, followed by third basemen. The designated hitters also make a lot, but there are only a few of them in the data set.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• As a whole, pitchers don’t make as much as first basemen and third basemen, but there are a lot of pitchers who are high-earning outliers.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Except for a few notable exceptions, catchers receive the lowest salaries.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because these side-by-side box plots are so easy to obtain, you can generate a lot of them to provide insights into the salary data. Several interesting examples appear in Figures 3.8–3.10. These box plots lead to the following conclusions:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Pitchers make somewhat less than other players, although there are many outliers in each group.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The Yankees payroll is indeed much larger than the payrolls for the rest of the teams. In fact, it is so large that its stars’ salaries aren’t even considered outliers relative to the rest of the team.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Aside from the many outliers, the playoff teams from 2017 tend to have slightly larger payrolls than the non-playoff teams. The one question we cannot answer, however, at least not without additional data, is whether these larger payrolls are a cause or an effect of being successful.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can often create a categorical variable on the fly with an IF formula and then use it for side-by-side box plots. We did this with the Yankees, for example.</p>
