            <p class="blog">Design of a strap footing. In a strap or connected footing, the exterior footing is placed eccentrically under its column so that it does not project beyond the property line. Such an eccentric position would result in a strongly uneven distribution of bearing pressure, which could lead to tilting of the footing. To counteract this eccentricity, the footing is connected by a beam or strap to the nearest interior footing.</p>

Both footings are so proportioned that under service load the pressure under each of them is uniform and the same under both footings. To achieve this, it is necessary, as in other combined footings, that the centroid of the combined area for the two footings coincide with the resultant of the column loads. The resulting forces are shown schematically in Fig. 15.18. They consist of the loads <span class="tex-text">\(P_e and P_i\)</span> of the exterior and interior columns, respectively, and of the net upward pressure q, which is uniform and equal under both footings. The resultants <span class="tex-text">\(R_e and R_i\)</span> of these upward pressures are also shown. Since the interior footing is concentric with the interior column, <span class="tex-text">\(R_i and P_i\)</span> are collinear. This is not the case for the exterior forces <span class="tex-text">\(R_e and P_e\)</span> where the resulting couple just balances the effect of the eccentricity of the column relative to the center of the footing. The strap proper is generally constructed so that it will not bear on the soil. This can be achieved by providing formwork not only for the sides but also for the bottom face and by withdrawing it before backfilling.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To illustrate this design, the columns in  will now be supported on a strap footing. Its general shape, plus dimensions as determined only subsequently by calculations, is seen in Fig. 15.19. With an allowable bearing pressure of <span class="tex-text">\(q_a = 6.0 kips/ft^2\)</span> and a depth of 6 ft to the bottom of the footing as before, the bearing pressure available for carrying the external loads applied to the footing is <span class="tex-text">\(q_e = 5.15 kips/ft^2\)</span>, as in . These external loads, for the strap footing, consist of the column loads and of the weight plus fill and surcharge of that part of the strap that is located between the footings. (The portion of the strap located directly on top of the footing displaces a corresponding amount of fill and therefore is already accounted for in the determination of the available bearing pressure q.) If the bottom of the strap is 6 in. above the bottom of the footings to prevent bearing on soil, the total depth to grade is 5.5 ft. If the strap width is estimated to be 2.5 ft, its estimated weight plus fill and surcharge is <span class="tex-text">\(2.5 \times 5.5 \times 0.125 + 0.100 \times 2.5 = 2\)</span> kips/ft. If the gap between footings is estimated to be 8 ft, the total weight of the strap is 16 kips. Hence, for purposes of determining the required footing area, 8 kips will be added to the dead load of each column. The required total area of both footings is then (750 + 16)/5.15 = 149 <span class="tex-text">\(ft^2\)</span>. The distance of the resultant of the two column loads plus the strap load from the axis of the exterior column, with sufficient accuracy, is <span class="tex-text">\(458 \times 18/766\)</span> = 10.75 ft, or 11.50 ft from the outer edge, almost identical to that calculated for . Trial calculations show that a rectangular footing <span class="tex-text">\(6 ft 0 in. \times 11 ft 3 in.\)</span> under the exterior column and a square footing <span class="tex-text">\(9 \times 9\)</span> ft under the interior column have a combined area of 149 <span class="tex-text">\(ft^2\)</span> and a distance from the outer edge to the centroid of the combined areas of <span class="tex-text">\((6 \times 11.25 \times 3 + 9 \times 9 \times 18.75) ÷ 149\)</span> = 11.55 ft, which is almost exactly equal to the previously calculated distance to the resultant of the external forces.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For strength calculations, the bearing pressure caused by the factored external loads, including that of the strap with its fill and surcharge, is</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(q_u = \frac{1.2(170 + 250 + 16) + 1.6(130 + 200)}{149} = 7.06 kips/ft^2\)</span> <p class="blog">
<strong>Design of footings</strong><br /> The exterior footing performs exactly like a wall footing with a length of 6 ft. Even though the column is located at its edge, the balancing action of the strap results in uniform bearing pressure, the downward load being transmitted to the footing uniformly by the strap. Hence, the design is carried out exactly as it is for a wall footing (see Section 15.5).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The interior footing, even though it merges in part with the strap, can safely be designed as an independent, square single-column footing (see Section 15.6). The main difference is that, because of the presence of the strap, punching shear cannot occur along the truncated pyramid surface shown in Fig. 15.6. For this reason, two-way or punching shear, according to Eq. (15.7), should be checked along a perimeter section located at a distance d/2 outward from the longitudinal edges of the strap and from the free face of the column, d being the effective depth of the footing. Flexural or one-way shear, as usual, is checked at a section a distance d from the face of the column.</p>

 <p class="blog">
<strong>Design of strap</strong><br /> Even though the strap is in fact monolithic with the interior footing, the effect on the strap of the soil pressure under this footing can safely be neglected because the footing has been designed to withstand the entire upward pressure as if the strap were absent. In contrast, because the exterior footing has been designed as a wall footing that receives its load from the strap, the upward pressure from the wall footing becomes a load that must be resisted by the strap. With this simplification of the actually somewhat more complex situation, the strap represents a single-span beam loaded upward by the bearing pressure under the exterior footing and supported by downward reactions at the centerlines of the two columns (Fig. 15.20). A width of 30 in. is selected.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For a column width of 24 in., this permits beam and column bars to be placed without interference where the two members meet and allows the column forms to be supported on the top surface of the strap. The maximum moment, as determined by equating the shear force to zero, occurs close to the inner edge of the exterior footing. Shear forces are large in the vicinity of the exterior column. Stirrup design is completed using a strut-and-tie model. The footing is drawn approximately to scale in Fig. 15.19, which also shows the general arrangement of the reinforcement in the footings and the strap.</p>
