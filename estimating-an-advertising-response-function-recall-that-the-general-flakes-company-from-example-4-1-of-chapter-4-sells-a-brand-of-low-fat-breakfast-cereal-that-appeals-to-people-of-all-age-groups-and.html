The company has advertised this product in various media for a number of years and has accumulated data on its advertising effectiveness. For example, the company has tracked the number of exposures to young men from ads placed on a particular television show for five different time periods. In each of these time periods, a different number of ads was used. Specifically, the numbers of ads were 1, 8, 20, 50, and 100. The corresponding numbers of exposures (in millions) were 4.7, 22.1, 48.7, 90.3, and 130.5. What type of nonlinear response function might fit these data well?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use nonlinear optimization to find the response function (from a given class of functions) that best fits the historical data.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The question here is how the company measures the number of exposures a given number of ads has achieved. In particular, what does the company mean by “exposures”? If one person sees the same ad 10 times, does this mean 10 exposures? Is it the same thing as 10 people seeing the same ad once each? Although we defer to the marketing experts here, we suggest that one person seeing the same ad 10 times results in fewer exposures than 10 people seeing the same ad once each. In any case, regardless of how the marketing experts decide to count exposures, it should lead to the decreasing marginal effects built into this example.</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p>

The chart in Figure 7.26 is a scatter chart of the historical data (with the points connected). The chart clearly indicates a nonlinear pattern, where extra ads have less effect than the first few ads. Many mathematical functions have this basic shape, and we could use any of them. However, we settle here for one of the simplest, a function of the form</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(f(n) = a(1 &#8211; e^{-bn})\)</span> (7.4)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here, n is the number of ads placed, f (n) is the resulting number of exposures, a and b are constants to estimate, and e is a special number approximately equal to 2.718. This function has some nice properties: (1) it is 0 when n = 0; (2) it increases at a decreasing rate when b &gt;0; and (3) it increases to a as n gets large. This latter property is the saturation effect we mentioned previously. The only question, then, is which values of a and b to use to match the historical data in Figure 7.26 as well as possible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To do this, we use a standard estimation procedure. Although the spreadsheet details are given shortly, it is worth discussing the idea behind this procedure first. Using the model in Equation (7.4) with any values of a and b, we predict the number of exposures we would obtain for 1, 8, 20, 50, or 100 ads. Then we compare these to the actual exposures observed, using a goodness-of-fit measure. The specific goodness-of-fit measure used here is the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted exposures, which has been used frequently in estimation problems. Specifically, we use Solver to find the constants a and b that minimize the sum of squared prediction errors. Of course, the squares make this a nonlinear optimization model<span class="tex-text">\(.^{5}\)</span></p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> Least Squares Estimation<br /> In many situations, the goal is to fit a curve of a certain functional form to a set of observed data. Although goodness of fit can be measured in several alternative ways, a popular method is to use the sum of squared prediction errors as the criterion to minimize. The resulting optimization problem is often unconstrained; we want the parameters of the curve<br /> that provides the best fit. Because of the squared prediction errors, this problem is inherently nonlinear, but it is usually very amenable to analysis. Least squares estimation appears in many areas. For example, it is used later in this chapter to estimate football ratings and to estimate the beta of a stock, and it is the basis for the regression analysis discussed in Chapter 13.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The variables for this estimation problem are shown in Figure 7.27, and the completed spreadsheet model is shown in Figure 7.28. (See the files Advertising Response Big Picture.xlsx and Advertising Response Finished.xlsx.) The model can be created with the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the historical data in the light blue region. There are no other inputs.<br /> 2) Parameters of response function. Enter any values for the constants a and b of the advertising response function in cells B4 and B5. These become the decision variable cells.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Predicted exposures. Use Equation (7.4), with the values of a and b in cells B4 and B5, to calculate the predicted number of exposures for each number of ads. To do this, enter the formula<br /> =$B$4*(1-EXP(-$B$5*A9))<br /> in cell C9, and copy it down to cell C13.<br /> 4) Squared errors. Calculate the squared difference between actual and predicted exposures by entering the formula<br /> =(B9-C9)^2<br /> in cell D9 and copying it down to cell D13.<br /> 5) Objective to minimize. Minimizing the sum of squared errors is equivalent to minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE), which is the square root of the average of the squared errors. To use RMSE as the objective to minimize, enter the formula<br /> =SQRT(AVERAGE(D9:D13))<br /> in cell D14. (One reason to use RMSE as the objective, rather than the sum of squared errors, is that RMSE is a smaller number and is less likely to give Solver numerical problems.<br /> Besides, RMSE has historically been a popular measure to minimize. In any case, you will get the same solution either way.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> This is a particularly simple Solver setup (not shown). The objective is to minimize RMSE by using cells B4 and B5 (jointly range-named Parameters) as the decision variable cells. There are no constraints, not even nonnegativity constraints<span class="tex-text">\(.^{6}\)</span> An optimization model with no constraints is called an unconstrained model. (Actually, as explained shortly, you can add bounds on the decision variable cells for use with the Multistart option.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The Solver solution in Figure 7.28 indicates that setting a = 155.02 and b = 0.0181 in Equation (7.4) provides the best possible fit to the historical data. A glance at the Actual and Predicted columns in rows 9 to 13 indicates that this fit is quite good. You can then see what this version of Equation (7.4) looks like, as well as the number of exposures it would predict for other numbers of ads. You can do this numerically and graphically, as shown in Figure 7.29. For example, the formula in cell B18 is =$B$4*(1-EXP(-$B$5*A18)), which is copied down. You can then plot the values in columns A and B to obtain the curve in the figure. The response function increases at a decreasing rate and approaches a = 155.02 as the number of ads gets large.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> Verifying whether RMSE is a concave function of the two parameters a and b is fairly difficult. Therefore, the best approach is to use Solver’s Multistart option. Recall that this works best if lower and upper bounds are imposed on the decision variable cells. Although there are no obvious bounds for a and b, you can try 0.001 and 1 for a, and 50 and 250 for b. This leads to the solution in Figure 7.28. Alternatively, instead of using Multistart, you could run Solver repeatedly from different starting solutions. You should see that Solver finds the solution in Figure 7.28 for some starting solutions, but not for really “bad” ones. This is typical of many nonlinear optimization models. Unless the starting solution is reasonably close to the optimal solution,<br /> Solver can go to a completely wrong solution. This is the reason why the Multistart option is such a welcome feature of Solver.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> We used the popular sum-of-squared-errors measure (or its RMSE equivalent) to find the bestfitting response function. Another possibility is to use the sum (or average) of the absolute errors (or the absolute percentage errors). Still another possibility is to use the maximum of the absolute errors. All of these have been used in estimation problems, and all lead to nonlinear optimization models. They typically lead to similar, but not necessarily identical, solutions. We used the sum-of-squared-errors measure because it has historically been a frequently used measure and leads to a smooth nonlinear model—the kind that Solver handles best.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now that you know how a company can estimate the advertising response function for any type of ad to any group of customers, you can use this type of response function in an advertising selection model.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
5: Three possible error measures, MAPE, RMSE, and MAE, were introduced in  of Chapter 2. The measure used here is equivalent to RMSE, but MAPE or MAE could be used instead.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6:Because of the increasing nature of the historical data and the form of the response function in Equation (7.4), you would expect a and b to be nonnegative, but it is not necessary to constrain them to be nonnegative.</p>
