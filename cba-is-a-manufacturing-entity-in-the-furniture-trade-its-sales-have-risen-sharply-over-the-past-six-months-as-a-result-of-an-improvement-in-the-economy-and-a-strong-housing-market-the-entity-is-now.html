            <p class="blog">CBA is a manufacturing entity in the furniture trade. Its sales have risen sharply over the past six months as a result of an improvement in the economy and a strong housing market. The entity is now showing signs of ‘overtrading’ and the financial manager, Ms Smith, is concerned about its liquidity. The entity is one month from its year end. Estimated figures for the full 12 months of the current year and forecasts for next year, on present cash management policies, are shown below.</p> <p class="blog">. Next year Current year</p> <p class="blog">. $000 $000<br /> Income Statement<br /> Turnover 5,200 4,200<br /> Less<br /> Cost of sales (Note 1) 3,224 2,520<br /> Operating expenses 1,650 1,500<br /> Operating profit 1,326 1,180<br /> Interest paid 11,54 11,48<br /> Profit before tax 1,272 1,132<br /> Tax payable 1,305 1,283<br /> Profit after tax 1,967 1,849<br /> Dividends declared 387 339<br /> Current assets and liabilities as at the end of the year<br /> Inventory/work in progress 625 350<br /> Trade receivables 750 520<br /> Cash 0 25<br /> Trade payables (464) (320)<br /> Other payables (tax and dividends) (692) (622)<br /> Overdraft (11) (0)<br /> Net current assets/(liabilities) 208 (47)<br /> Note 1:<br /> Cost of sales includes depreciation of 225 175</p> <p class="blog">Ms Smith is considering methods of improving the cash position. A number of actions are being discussed:<br /> Trade receivables<br /> Offer a 2 per cent discount to customers who pay within 10 days of despatch of invoices. It is estimated that 50 per cent of customers will take advantage of the new discount scheme. The other 50 per cent will continue to take the current average credit period.<br /> Trade payables and inventory<br /> Reduce the number of suppliers currently being used and negotiate better terms with those that remain by introducing a ‘just-in-time’ policy. The aim will be to reduce the end-of-year forecast cost of sales (excluding depreciation) by 5 per cent and inventory/work in progress levels by 10 per cent. However, the number of days’ credit taken by the entity will have to fall to 30 days to help persuade suppliers to improve their prices.<br /> Other information<br /> ● All trade is on credit. Official terms of sale at present require payment within 30 days. Interest is not charged on late payments.<br /> ● All purchases are made on credit.<br /> ● Operating expenses will be $650,000 under either the existing or proposed policies.<br /> ● Interest payments would be $45,000 if the new policies are implemented.<br /> ● Capital expenditure of $550,000 is planned for next year.</p>

 <p class="blog">
(b) Report<br /> To: Ms Smith<br /> From: Assistant<br /> Subject: Proposed working capital policy changes<br /> The answer should be set out in report format and include the following key points:<br /> ● Comment that cash flow is improved by almost a quarter of a million pounds if the proposed changes are made.<br /> ● Problems appear to have arisen because trade recievables and inventory control have not been adequate for increased levels of turnover.<br /> ● Liquidity: current ratio was 0.95:1 (all current assets to trade and other payables), will be around 1.2:1 under both options. Perversely, ratio looks to improve even ifentity takes no action and causes an overdraft. This is because of high receivables and<br /> inventory levels. Moral: high current assets do not mean high cash. Cash ratio perhaps a better measure.<br /> ● Receivables’ days last year was 45, forecast to rise to 53 on current policies despite ‘official’ terms being 30. Entity could perhaps look to improve its credit control before offering discounts.<br /> ● Trade payables’ days were 46, forecast to rise to 52. Are discounts being ignored? Are relationships with suppliers being threatened?*<br /> ● Dramatic increase in inventory levels forecast: 50 days last year, 71 days forecast this year. If change implemented, inventory will still be 67 days.*<br /> ● Operating profit percentage forecast to fall to 25.5 per cent from 281.1 per cent if no changes made. Percentage will fall to 27.4 per cent if changes implemented; a fall probably acceptable if cash flow improved and overdraft interest saved.<br /> ● Non-financial factors include relationships with customers and suppliers.<br /> ● Other financial factors, is increase in turnover sustainable?<br /> * Using cost of sales figures including depreciation.</p>
