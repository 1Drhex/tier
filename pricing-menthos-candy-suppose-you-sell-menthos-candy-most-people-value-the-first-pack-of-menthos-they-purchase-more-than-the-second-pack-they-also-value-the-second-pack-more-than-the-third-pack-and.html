            <p class="blog">Pricing Menthos Candy<br /> Suppose you sell Menthos candy. Most people value the first pack of Menthos they purchase more than the second pack. They also value the second pack more than the third pack, and so on. How can you take advantage of this when pricing Menthos? If you charge a single price for each pack of Menthos, only a few people are going to buy more than one or two packs. Alternatively, however, you can try a two-part tariff approach, where you charge an “entry fee” to anyone who buys Menthos, plus a reduced price per pack purchased. For example, if a reasonable single price per pack is $1.10, then a reasonable two-part tariff might be an entry fee of $1.50 and a price of $0.50 per pack. This gives some customers an incentive to purchase many packs of Menthos. Because the total cost of purchasing n packs of Menthos is no longer a linear function of n—it is now piecewise linear— the two-part tariff is a nonlinear pricing strategy.</p> <p class="blog">As usual with pricing models, the key input is customer sensitivity to price. Rather than having a single demand function, however, we now assume that each customer has a unique sensitivity to price. To keep the example fairly small, we assume that four typical customers from the four market segments for the product have been asked what they would pay for each successive pack of Menthos, with the results listed in Figure 8.7. For example, customer 1 is willing to pay $1.24 for the first pack of Menthos, $1.03 for the second pack, and only $0.35 for the tenth pack. These four customers are considered representative of the four market segments. If it costs $0.40 to produce a pack of Menthos, determine a profit- maximizing single price and a profit-maximizing two-part tariff. Assume that the four market segments have 10,000, 5000, 7500, and 15,000 customers, respectively, and that the customers within a market segment all respond identically to price.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use Evolutionary Solver to find the best pricing strategies for customers who value each succeeding unit of a product less than the previous unit.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The price sensitivity data listed in Figure 8.7 would be the most difficult to find. However, a well-studied technique in marketing research called conjoint analysis can be used to estimate such data. See Green et al. (2001) for a nontechnical discussion of conjoint analysis.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/8.7-4.png"></div>

You should first set up the single-price model. Then, with very little modification, you can develop the two-part tariff model. The approach for each model is indicated in Figure 8.8. (See the file Pricing Menthos Big Picture.xlsx.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
For any pricing scheme, you need to calculate the customer’s cost if she purchases n packs. Then you can compare this cost to the corresponding value in the appropriate column in Figure 8.7. As an example, suppose you charge a single price of $0.80 per pack. If a customer of type 2 purchases three packs, the surplus value to this customer is the total value to her of the three packs, $0.92 + $0.85 + $0.69 = $2.46, minus the total price of the packs, $2.40. Because the value is greater than the total price, a purchase of three packs is attractive to this customer. We assume that a customer of a given type will purchase the quantity n that provides the largest surplus value. In simple terms, each customer buys the quantity that provides the largest difference between value and total price. However, if a customer’s surplus value is always negative, this customer won’t purchase any packs.<br /> By knowing how many packs each customer segment will purchase at each price, you can then maximize the company’s profit by setting the price accordingly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Single-Price Model</strong><br /> The single-price model appears in Figure 8.9. (See the Pricing Menthos with Single Price Finished.xlsx file.) It can be formed with the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the inputs in the light blue ranges. Note that the large blue range is the price sensitivity table from Figure 8.7.<br /> 2) Price. The only decision variable in this model is the single price charged for every pack of Menthos sold. Enter any value in this Unit_price cell.<br /> 3) Total value table. The values in the blue price sensitivity range are marginal values, the most each customer would pay for the next pack of Menthos. In the range H6:K15, calculate the total value of n packs for each customer (for n from 1 to 10). First, enter the formula<br /> =B6</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell H6 and copy it across row 6. Then enter the formula<br /> =H6+B7<br /> in cell H7 and copy it to the range H7:K15.<br /> 4) Total price column. Using the single-price scheme, each customer must pay np for n packs if the price is p. Calculate these amounts in the range E19:E28 by entering the formula<br /> =Unit_price*D19<br /> in cell E19 and copying down.<br /> 5) Surplus table. This is the key to the model. You need to calculate the surplus for any customer from buying n packs as the total value of n packs minus the total cost of n packs. Then the assumption is that the customer buys the number of packs with the largest surplus. This makes sense economically. If a customer places more value on n packs than it costs to buy n packs, then presumably the customer will consider purchasing n packs. But a customer will not purchase n packs if they cost more than she values them. To calculate these surplus values, enter the formula<br /> =H6-$E19<br /> in cell H19 and copy it to the range H19:K28.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Maximum surplus. Calculate the maximum surplus for each customer by entering the formula<br /> =MAX(H19:H28)<br /> in cell B32 and copying it across row 32.<br /> 7) Packs purchased. For each customer, you need to find the number of packs that corresponds to the maximum surplus. This can be done best with Excel’s MATCH function. Specifically, enter the formula<br /> =IF(B32&lt;0,0,MATCH(B32,H19:H28,0))<br /> in cell B33 and copy it across row 33. This formula says that if the maximum surplus is negative, the customer will not purchase any packs at all. Otherwise, it matches the maximum surplus to the entries in the range H19:H28 and returns the index of the cell where the match occurs. In this example, the match for customer 1 occurs in the fourth cell of the range H19:H28, so the MATCH function returns 4. (Note that the last argument of the MATCH function is 0 if you want an exact match, as you do here.) Then calculate the total number of packs purchased by all customers with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B34:E34,B33:E33)<br /> in cell B36.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Function:</strong> MATCH<br /> The MATCH function, with the syntax MATCH(value,range,type), returns the position (as an integer) of the first match to value in the given range. For example, if value is 6 and the values in the given range are 8, 7, 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, the MATCH function returns 3. The type argument is usually set to 0, which returns an exact match. Other options for the type parameter can be found in Excel’s online help.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8) Profit. Calculate the profit in cell B37 with the formula<br /> =(Unit_price-Unit_cost)*B36</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> First, note that GRG Nonlinear Solver has trouble with this model because of the MAX, IF, and MATCH functions. However, these functions present no difficulties to Evolutionary Solver. It should be set up as shown in Figure 8.10, using the same values for the Evolutionary options as in the previous example. Note that an upper limit of $1.50 has been used for the unit price. This suffices because the most any customer will pay for any pack of Menthos is $1.49.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> Again, Evolutionary Solver converges to the solution in Figure 8.9 quickly and then tries for a long time—unsuccessfully—to find a better solution. You can be fairly certain that this solution is optimal, but this is not guaranteed. The single price of $0.80 produces a profit of $62,000. It strikes the best balance for these four market segments. A lower price would needlessly sacrifice revenue, whereas a higher price would cause at least one market segment to buy fewer packs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Two-Part Tariff Model</strong><br /> The two-part tariff model is so similar that you can make a copy of the Pricing Menthos with Single Price Finished.xlsx file and then make the following modifications. (See Figure 8.11 and the Pricing Menthos with Two-Part Tariff Finished.xlsx file.) The steps that are the same as before are omitted.<br /> 1) Decision variables. Now there are two decision variables— the fixed entry fee and the variable cost per pack. Enter any values for these in cells B20 and B21.<br /> 2) Total price column. The total price of purchasing n packs is now the fixed entry fee plus the variable price times n. Calculate this in the range E19:E28 by entering the formula<br /> =Fixed_price+Variable_price*D19<br /> in cell E19 and copying it to the rest of the range.<br /> 3) Revenues. Calculate the amount paid by the customers in row 34 by entering the formula<br /> =IF(B33&gt;0,Fixed_price+Variable_price*B33,0)<br /> in cell B34 and copying it across. Note that the entry fee is evidently too high for customer 2, so she does not purchase any packs, and there is no corresponding revenue.<br /> 4) Profit. Calculate the profit in the Profit cell with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B34:E34:B35:E35)-Unit_cost*B37</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Evolutionary Solver setup (not shown here) is almost the same as before. However, you should now select both the Fixed_price and Variable_price cells as decision variable cells, and you should put upper limits on each of them. (We used $10 as an upper limit on Fixed_price and $1.50 for Variable_price, reasoning that these would almost certainly be large enough.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 8.11 was found after about a minute. The solution indicates that the company should charge all customers $3.31 plus $0.40 for each pack purchased. This pricing scheme is too high for the second market segment, which doesn’t buy any packs, but it entices segments 1, 3, and 4 to purchase many more packs than they purchased with the single price of $0.80. (Check the price sensitivity columns for these segments. Can you see why they are willing to purchase so many packs with this particular two- part tariff?) More important, it yields a profit of $107,567, about 73% more than the profit from the single-price policy. The moral is clear—clever pricing schemes can make companies significantly larger profits than the simple pricing schemes that are often used.</p>
