            <p class="blog">A local education authority is faced with a predicted decline in the demand for school places in its area. It is believed that some schools will have to close in order to remove up to 800 places from current capacity levels. The schools that may face closure are referenced as A, B, C or D. Their details are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>School A (capacity 200) was built 15 years ago at a cost of £1.2m. It is situated in a ‘socially disadvantaged’ community area. The authority has been offered £14m for the site by a property developer.</li> <li>School B (capacity 500) was built 20 years ago and cost £1m. It was renovated only two years ago at a cost of £3m to improve its facilities. An offer of £8m has been made for the site by a business planning a shopping complex in this affluent part of the town.</li> <li>School C (capacity 600) cost £5m to build five years ago. The land for this school is rented from a local business for an annual cost of £300,000.</li> <li>School D (capacity 800) cost £7m to build eight years ago; last year £1.5m was spent on an extension. It has a considerable amount of grounds, which is currently used for sporting events. This factor makes it popular with developers, who have recently offered £9m for the site.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">In the accounting system, the local authority depreciates non-current (fixed) assets based on 2 per cent a year on the original cost. It also differentiates between one-off, large items of capital expenditure or revenue, and annually recurring items.</p> <p class="blog">The land rented for School C is based on a 100-year lease. If the school closes, the property reverts immediately to the owner. If School C is not closed, it will require a £3m investment to improve safety at the school.<br /> If School D is closed, it will be necessary to pay £1.8m to adapt facilities at other schools to accommodate the change.<br /> The local authority has a central staff, which includes administrators for each school costing £200,000 a year for each school, and a chief education officer costing £80,000 a year in total.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong>:<br /> (a) Prepare a summary of the relevant cash flows (costs and revenues, relative to not making any closures) under the following options:<br /> (i) closure of D only<br /> (ii) closure of A and B<br /> (iii) closure of A and C.<br /> Show separately the one-off effects and annually recurring items, rank the options open to the local authority, and briefly interpret your answer. Note: Various approaches are acceptable provided that they are logical.<br /> (b) Identify and comment on any two different types of irrelevant cost contained in the information given in the question.<br /> (c) Discuss other factors that might have a bearing on the decision.</p>

On the basis of the financial figures alone, closure of either A and B or A and C looks best. It is not possible to add the one-off and the recurring costs directly, but the large one-off cost saving associated with closing schools A and B makes this option look attractive. (In Chapter 8 we shall see that it is possible to add one-off and recurring costs in a way that should lead to sensible conclusions.)<br /> (b) The costs of acquiring and improving the schools in the past are past costs or sunk costs and, therefore, irrelevant. The costs of employing the chief education officer is a future cost, but irrelevant because it is not dependent on outcomes, it is a common cost.<br /> (c) There are many other factors, some of a non-quantifiable nature. These include:</p>
 <ul> <li>Accuracy of projections of capacity requirements.</li> <li>Locality of existing schools relative to where potential pupils live.</li> <li>Political acceptability of selling schools to property developers.</li> <li>Importance of purely financial issues in making the final decision.</li> <li>The quality of the replacement sporting facilities compared with those at school D.</li> <li>Political acceptability of staff redundancies.</li> <li>Possible savings/costs of employing fewer teachers, which might be relevant if economies of scale are available by having fewer schools.</li> <li>Staff morale.</li> </ul>
