            <p class="blog"><strong>Battery Storage in a BEV</strong></p> <p class="blog">The Nissan Leaf is a BEV that has an engine power of 80 kW and gets up to 3.5 miles per kWh. Its battery can hold 24 kWh of energy of which the recommended discharge in each round of use is not more than 80 percent. The replacement battery pack weighs 300 kg (660 lb.), costs $5,500 plus $200 for installation, and is warranted for five years or 60,000 miles, whichever comes first. A home charging station for the Leaf costs $1,000, and for the purpose of this example we assume a useful life of 10 years. Nissan does not publish the efficiency losses of its battery upon charging or during storage or discharge, but we may conservatively assume the battery loses 5 percent of the energy taken in when it is charged, and it loses 5 percent of its stored energy during storage or when it is being discharged. For financial purposes, assume a personal discount rate of 6 percent per year. Consider the following questions for an owner who drives the Nissan Leaf 12,000 miles per year.</p> <p class="blog">(a) What is the capacity cost of the Leaf battery?<br /> (b) What is the expected driving range of the Leaf on one charge of the battery?<br /> (c) What is the levelized cost of the battery, and what is the levelized cost of the charging station? What is therefore the total levelized cost of the system?<br /> (d) How much energy does an owner use when driving 12,000 miles per year?<br /> (e) What is the AFC of the energy delivered to the motor over 12,000 miles per year?<br /> (f) If the price of residential electric energy is $0.12 per kWh, and the user always charges the Leaf at home using the charging station, what is the effective price of the electric energy, recognizing the one-way efficiency loss of the system?<br /> (g) What is the ATC of electric energy delivered to the motor for the owner who drives the Leaf 12,000 miles per year?<br /> (h) How does the answer to (g) change if the Leaf goes 20,000 miles per year?</p>

                <p class="blog">
(a) Recall that batteries are unusual as a technology in their definition of capacity. For batteries, the meaning of capacity follows the familiar use of the word as an amount that can be stored, not the main definition as output rate per unit of time. The capacity cost of the Leaf battery is therefore its installed cost $5,700 divided by its capacity of 24 kWh, giving 238 $/kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The expected range of the Leaf will be the dischargeable capacity of the battery, which is 80% of 24 kWh, discounted for a one-way loss of electric energy in storage and discharge equal to 5 percent, then multiplied by the efficiency of the Leaf in miles/kWh. We get 80% × 24 × (1–5%) × 3.5 = 64 miles.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The life of a BEV battery is limited by its usage, not by the passage of time. We use the warrantied 60,000 miles as the useful range, so at a usage of 12,000 miles per year, the Leaf battery will last five years. The levelized cost of the $5,700 battery over this five-year calendar life is given by the spreadsheet function =PMT(6%,5,–5700), which returns the number $1,353 per year. The levelized cost of the $1,000 charging station over its 10-year warranted life is given by the spreadsheet function =PMT(6%,10,–1000), which returns the number $136 per year. The total of these is $1,489 per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) The amount of energy that must go into the electric motor, when the owner drives 12,000 miles per year is 12,000 (miles/year) divided by 3.5 (miles/kWh) = 3,429 kWh per year.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) The average fixed cost (AFC) of the energy delivered to the motor in a year is the levelized system cost $1,489 divided by the 3,429 kWh delivered per year, which is $0.434 per kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(f) The amount of (input) energy that needs to be drawn from the owner’s house, through the charging station, into the battery is equal to the (output) energy stored in the battery divided by the 95 percent efficiency of the charging process. Therefore, the effective price of the stored energy is $0.1200/95% = $0.1263. This stored energy is subject to another 5 percent efficiency loss when it is discharged from the battery, causing the effective price of the energy delivered to the motor to be $0.1263/95% = $0.133 per kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(g) The total average cost of energy delivered to the motor, assuming 12,000 miles driven per year, is therefore $0.434 + $0.133 = $0.567 per kWh. It is interesting to see that the effective price of the energy delivered to the motor is so much higher than the price paid at the plug (the $0.12 per kWh).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(h) When these calculations are set up in a spreadsheet model, it is a simple matter to change the annual mileage from 12,000 to 20,000 and see how the answers change. Doing so, one sees that the levelized cost of the device (now over three years, not five) goes up to $2,132 per year, AFC per kWh falls only a little, from $0.434 to $0.397. The variable cost of the energy is not affected by the annual usage, so it remains $0.133, so the total average cost of delivered energy is $0.530.</p>
