The first step is to calculate his normal loan payment, remaining balance after 12 such payments, and his total monthly payment.<br /> Payment = 100K(A/P, .70833%, 360) = 100K × .0076891 = $768.91/month<br /> Balance12 = 768.91(P/A, .70833%, 360 &#8211; 12) = $99,244<br /> Total payment = 768.91 + 840/12 + 1800/12 = $988.91/month</p>
 <p class="blog">
As described in the accompanying text, an intuitive or approximate approach is to compare the extra payment to the principal portion of the next scheduled payment. Since the remaining balance is $99,244, the interest portion of the next payment is .0070833×99,244 $702.98. The principal portion is the remaining $65.94.<br /> If George pays an extra loan payment of $769, then this equals the principal payments of about the next 769/65.94 11.6 months. If he makes an extra monthly payment of $989, then this equals the principal payments of about the next 98965.94 = 15.0 months. These calculations will overstate the reduction, since the principal portion of the payment increases slightly each month.<br /> To calculate this exactly, the Excel function NPER(i, payment, remaining balance) is used. In each case, the remaining balance equals the balance after 12 months minus the extra payment. Remember that the payment and the remaining balance must have different signs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
NPER(.0070833, -768.91, 99244 &#8211; 768.91) = 336.76<br /> There were 348 periods left before the extra payment, and there are 336.76 now. Thus, making an extra loan payment of $769 saves 11.24 payments (about a year) from the end of the payment schedule.<br /> If George makes an extra total payment of $989, then the Excel function is<br /> NPER(.0070833, -768.91, 99244 &#8211; 988.91) = 333. 70<br /> In this case, the number of remaining payments has dropped from 348 to 333.70, or a savings of 14.3 payments from the end of the payment schedule.</p>
