First, there is no reduction on their exemptions because their joint income of $138,000 is less than $250,200 per year. Second, they are better off itemizing than claiming the standard deduction.<br /> Taxable income = 138,000 – Itemized deductions – 4 Exemptions<br /> = 138,000 – 15,000 – 4 × 3650 = $108,400<br /> Tax = .1 × 16,700 + .15(67,900 – 16,700) + .25(108,400 – 67,900) = $19,475<br /> Their marginal tax rate is 25%, and their average tax rate is 19,475/138,000 = 14.1%. Note that the child care credit would reduce their tax by 20% of the $6000 limit for 2 children, or $1200.<br /> Their actual expenses were nearly double the limit.</p>
