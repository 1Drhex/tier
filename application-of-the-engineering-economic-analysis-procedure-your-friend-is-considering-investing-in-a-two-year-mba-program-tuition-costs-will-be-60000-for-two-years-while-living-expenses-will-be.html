(a) Your friend is debating whether or not to invest in an MBA degree. The benefit from the degree is a higher income stream for the rest of her working life, but she cannot be certain of getting her dream job. Her problem, therefore, is that of risk: she takes on a large loan of $100,000 to finance the MBA, but cannot find a job afterwards that allows her to pay it off.<br /> (b) Her costs include tuition and living expenses over two years of $110,000 ($60,000 + $25,000 × 2). She also faces annual loan repayments of $10,500 over ten years, generating an interest cost of $5,000 ($105,000 − $100,000). Finally, she also loses earnings of $120,000 ($60,000 × 2) over two years, because she quits her job</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) Option (1). To do a lower-cost degree, such as a part-time MBA, so that she can work at the same time. This will reduce the direct and indirect costs of the MBA program, as well as the size of the debt she will have to take on. However, her expected income after this degree is also likely to be lower.<br /> Option (2). She could postpone the MBA and save more money for it. This will reduce the size of the loan she has to take on as well as the interest costs associated with servicing that loan. However, she will continue to earn at a lower level until she completes the MBA.<br /> Option (3). She could choose not to do the MBAat all and continue to work at her current income level.<br /> (d) One criterion could be to minimize risk, in which case you would advise her to take on either the second or the third option, involving no debt.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) “Credit worthiness” could be an additional criterion, whereby she is concerned about her credit rating. In this case, taking on any kind of debt without a guaranteed job at the end of the MBAwould be ruled out. Hence,<br /> option (3) may be her only option.<br /> (f) In order to reduce uncertainty regarding employment, your friend should gather information on the state of the job market in both the geographical area and the sector in which she wants to work. She should find out which MBAprograms are particularly strong at driving recruitment in her chosen job sector. She could also try to negotiate a job with a desired employer before starting the MBA program.</p>
