1. Current ratio:<br /> 2006: $146.4 ÷ $107.1 = 1.37:1 2005: $158.2 ÷ $119.0 = 1.33:1<br /> Tweeter’s liquidity improved slightly from 2005 to 2006, but in both years it would most likely have been considered inadequate. In 2006, Tweeter had only $1.37 in current assets for every dollar of current liabilities. Sometimes larger companies, such as Best Buy, can function with lower current ratios because they have alternative sources of working capital. But a company of Tweeter’s size would normally want a higher ratio.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Debt to assets:<br /> 2006: $190.4 ÷ $258.6 = 73.6% 2005: $201.1 ÷$284.0 = 70.8%<br /> Tweeter’s solvency, as measured by its debt to assets ratio, declined from 2005 to 2006. Its ratio of 73.6% meant that every dollar of assets was financed by 73.6 cents of debt. For a retailer, this is extremely high reliance on debt. This low solvency suggests Tweeter’s ability to meet its debt payments was questionable.<br /> Free cash flow:<br /> 2006: $15.6 &#8211; $17.4 &#8211; $0 = -$1.8 million 2005: 2$26.7 &#8211; $22.2 &#8211; $0 = -$48.9 million<br /> Tweeter’s free cash flow was negative in both years. The company did not generate enough net cash provided by operating activities even to cover its capital expenditures, and it was not paying a dividend. While this is not unusual for new companies in their early years, it is also not sustainable for very long. Part of the reason that its debt to assets ratio, discussed above, was so high was that it had to borrow money to make up for its deficient free cash flow.<br /> 3. Loss per share:<br /> 2006: -$16.5 ÷ 25.2 = -$0.65 per share<br /> 2005: -$74.4 ÷ 24.6 = -$3.02 per share<br /> Tweeter’s loss per share declined substantially. However, this was little consolation for its shareholders, who experienced losses in previous years as well. The company’s lack of profitability, combined with its poor liquidity and solvency, increased the likelihood that it would eventually file for bankruptcy.<br /> 4. Tweeter’s income statement covers 7 months not covered by Best Buy’s. Suppose that the economy changed dramatically during this 7-month period, either improving or declining. This change in the economy would be reflected in Tweeter’s income statement but would not be reflected in Best Buy’s income statement until the following March, thus reducing the usefulness of a comparison of the income statements of the two companies.</p>
