The range A1:O1001 is in the form of a data set—it is a rectangular range bounded by blank rows and columns, where each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and variable names appear in the top row. Therefore, it is a candidate for an Excel table. However, it doesn’t benefit from Excel’s table tools until you actually designate it as a table. To do so, select any cell in the data set, click the Table button in the left part of the Insert ribbon, and accept the default options. Or as a quicker alternative, use the Ctrl+t key combination. In either case, two things happen. First, the data set is designated as a table, it is formatted nicely, and a dropdown arrow appears next to each variable name, as shown in Figure 2.25. Second, a new Table Tools Design ribbon becomes available (see Figure 2.26). This ribbon is available any time the active cell is inside a table. Note that the table has a generic name like Table1 by default, but you can change this to a more descriptive name if you like.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can also designate a table by selecting any option on the Format as Table dropdown on the Home ribbon. A third alternative is even easier: select any cell in the data set and press Ctrl + t.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One handy feature of Excel tables is that the variable names remain visible even when you scroll down the screen. Try it to see how it works. When you scroll down far enough that the variable names would disappear, the column headers, A, B, C, etc., change to the variable names. Therefore, you no longer need to freeze panes or split the screen to see the variable names. However, this works only when the active cell is within the table. If you click outside the table, the column headers revert back to A, B, C, etc.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The dropdown arrows next to the variable names allow you to filter in many different ways. For example, click the Own Home dropdown list, uncheck Select All, and check the 1 box. This filters out all customers except those who own their own home. Filtering is discussed in more detail later on, but at this point, just be aware that filtering does not delete any observations; it only hides them. There are three indications that the table has been filtered: (1) the row numbers are colored blue and some are missing; (2) a message appears at the bottom of the screen indicating that only 516 out of 1000 records are visible; and (3) there is a filter icon next to the Own Home dropdown arrow. It is easy to remove this filter by opening the Own Home dropdown list and selecting Clear Filter, but don’t do so yet.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As illustrated in Figure 2.26, there are various options you can apply to tables, including the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• A number of table styles are available for making the table attractive. You can experiment with these, including the various table styles and table style options. Note the dropdown list in the Table Styles group. It gives you many more styles than the ones originally visible. There is even a “no color” style you might prefer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In the Tools group, you can click Convert to Range. This undesignates the range as a table (and the dropdown arrows disappear).</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In the Properties group, you can change the name of the table. You can also click the Resize Table button to expand or contract the table’s data range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• A particularly useful option is the Total Row in the Table Style Options group. If you check this, a new row is appended to the bottom of the table (see Figure 2.27). It creates a sum formula in the rightmost column.<span class="tex-text">\(^{5}\)</span> This sum includes only the nonhidden rows. To prove this to yourself, clear the Own Home filter and check the sum. It increases to $1,216,768. This total row is quite flexible. First, you can summarize the last column by a number of summary measures, such as Average, Max, Min, Count, and others. To do so, select cell O1002 and click the dropdown list that appears. Second, you can summarize any other column in the table in the same way. For example, if you select cell G1002, a dropdown list appears for Salary, and you can then summarize Salary with the same summarizing options.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Excel tables have a lot of built-in intelligence. Although there is not enough space here to explain all possibilities, try the following to see what we mean:</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Total row in an Excel table summarizes<br /> only the visible data. The data that has been filtered out is ignored.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In cell R2, enter a formula by typing an equals sign, pointing to cell O2, typing a divide sign (/), and pointing to cell G2. You do not get the usual formula =O2/G2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Instead you get =Table1[[#This Row],[AmountSpent]]/Table1[[#This Row],[Salary]]. This is certainly not the Excel syntax you are used to, but it makes perfect sense. <span class="tex-text">\(^{5}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
• Similarly, you can expand the table with a new variable, such as the ratio of Amount Spent to Salary. Start by typing the variable name Ratio in cell P1. Then in cell P2, enter a formula exactly as you did in the previous bullet. You will notice<br /> two things. First, as soon as you enter the Ratio label, column P becomes part of the table. Second, as soon as you enter the new formula in one cell, it is automatically copied to all of column P. This is what we mean by table intelligence.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Excel tables expand automatically as new rows are added to the bottom or new columns are added to the right. (You saw this latter behavior in the previous bullet.) To appreciate the benefit of this, suppose you have a monthly time series data set. You designate it as a table and then build a line chart from it to show the time series behavior. Later on, if you add new data to the bottom of the table, the chart will automatically update to include the new data. This is a great feature. In fact, when we discuss pivot tables in the next chapter, we will recommend basing them on tables, not ranges, whenever possible. Then they too will update automatically when new data are added to the table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Filtering</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
We now discuss ways of filtering data sets—that is, finding records that match particular criteria. One way to filter is to create an Excel table, as indicated in the previous subsection. This automatically provides the dropdown arrows next to the field names that provide many filter options. Indeed, this is the way we will filter in this section: on an existing table. However, a designated table is not required for filtering. You can filter on any rectangular data set with variable names. There are actually three ways to do so. For each method, the active cell should be a cell inside the data set.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Filtering is possible without using Excel tables, but there are definitely advantages to filtering with Excel tables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4 The actual formula is =SUBTOTA L(109,[AmountSpent]), where 109 is a code for summing. However, you never need to type any such formula; you can choose the summary function you want from the dropdown list.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5 If you don’t like this type of formula, you can go to Options under the File menu and uncheck the “Use table names in formulas” option in the Formulas group.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Use the Filter button from the Sort &amp; Filter dropdown list on the Home ribbon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Use the Filter button from the Sort &amp; Filter group on the Data ribbon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Right-click any cell in the data set and select Filter. You get several options, the most popular of which is Filter by Selected Cell’s Value. For example, if the selected cell has value 1 and is in the Children column, then only customers with a single child will remain visible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The point is that Microsoft realizes how important filtering is to Excel users. Therefore, they have made filtering a very prominent and powerful Excel tool.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As far as we can tell, the two main advantages of filtering on a table, as opposed to the three options just listed, are the nice formatting (banded rows, for example) provided by tables, and, more importantly, the total row. If this total row is showing, it summarizes only the visible records; the rows hidden by filters are ignored.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We now illustrate a number of filtering possibilities for the HyTex data. We won’t lead you through a lot of descriptions and screenshots. Once you know the possibilities that are available, you should find them quite easy to use.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on one or more values in a field. </strong>Click the Catalogs dropdown arrow. You will see five checkboxes, all checked: Select All, 6, 12, 18, and 24. To select one or more values, uncheck Select All and then check any values you want to filter on, such as 6 and 24. In this case, only customers who received 6 or 24 catalogs will remain visible.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on more than one field. </strong>With the Catalogs filter still in place, create a filter on some other field, such as customers with one child. When there are filters on multiple fields, only records that meet all of the criteria are visible, in this case customers with one child who received 6 or 24 catalogs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on a continuous numeric field.</strong> The Salary and Amount Spent fields are essentially continuous fields, so it would not make much sense to filter on one or a few particular values. However, it does make sense to filter on ranges of values, such as all salaries greater than $75,000. This is easy. Click the dropdown arrow next to Salary and select Number Filters. You will see a number of obvious possibilities, including Greater Than.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Top 10 and Above/Below Average filters. </strong>Continuing the previous bullet, the Number Filters include Top 10, Above Average, and Below Average options. These are particularly useful if you like to see the highs and the lows. The Above Average and Below Average filters do exactly what their names imply. The Top 10 filter is actually more flexible than its name implies. It can be used to select the top n items (where you can choose n), the bottom n items, the top n percent of items, or the bottom n percent of items. Note that if a Top 10 filter is used on a text field, the ordering is alphabetical. If it is used on a date field, the ordering is chronological.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The number of ways you can filter in Excel tables is virtually unlimited. Don’t be afraid to experiment. You can always clear filters to get back to where you started.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on a text field. </strong>If you click the dropdown arrow for a text field such as Region, you can choose one or more of its values, such as East and South, to filter on. You can also select the Text Filters item, which provides a number of choices, including Begins With, Ends With, Contains, and others. For example, if there were an Address field, you could use the Begins With option to find all addresses that begin with P.O. Box.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on a date field. </strong>Excel has great built-in intelligence for filtering on dates. If you click the First Purchase dropdown arrow, you will see an item for each year in the data set with plus signs next to them. By clicking on the plus signs, you can drill down to months and then days for as much control as you need. Figure 2.28 shows one possibility, where we have filtered out all dates except the first part of July 2015. In addition, if you select the Date Filters item, you get a number of possibilities, such as Yesterday, Next Week, Last Month, and many others.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Filter on color or icon. </strong>Excel has many ways to color cells or enter icons in cells. Often the purpose is to denote the sizes of the numbers in the cells, such as red for small numbers and green for large numbers. We won’t cover the possibilities in this book, but you can experiment with Conditional Formatting on the Home ribbon. The point is that cells are often colored in certain ways or contain certain icons. Therefore, Excel allows you to filter on background color, font color, or icon. For example, if certain salaries are colored yellow, you can isolate them by filtering on yellow.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• Use a custom filter. </strong>If nothing else works, you can try a custom filter, available at the bottom of the Number Filters, Text Filters, and Date Filters lists. Figures 2.29 and 2.30 illustrate two possibilities. The first of these filters out all salaries between $25,000 and $75,000. Without a custom filter, this wouldn’t be possible. The second filter uses the * wildcard to find regions ending in est (West and Midwest). Admittedly, this is an awkward way to perform this filter, but it indicates how flexible custom filters can be.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We remind you once again that if you filter on an Excel table and you have summary measures in a total row at the bottom of the table, these summary measures are based only on the filtered data; they ignore the hidden rows.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One final comment about filters is that when you click the dropdown arrow for any variable, you always get three items at the top for sorting, not filtering (see Figure 2.28, for example). These allow you to perform the obvious sorts, from high to low or vice versa, and they even allow you to sort on color. As with filtering, you do not need to designate an Excel table to perform sorting (the popular A-Z and Z-A buttons work just fine without tables), but sorting is made even easier with tables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Other Useful Ways to Filter</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The Advanced Filter tool is useful for implementing an OR filter, such as all customers who are either male with salary above $40,000 OR female with at least two children. In fact, it is probably the most natural way to implement such a filter. However, there is another way that is used in the solutions of a few problems in Chapter 2. Suppose you want a filter of the type A OR B, where A and B are any conditions, maybe even AND conditions. Create two columns labeled Condition A and Condition B. Fill each with an IF formula that returns Yes or No, depending on whether the condition holds in that row. Then create a third new column labeled Condition A or B, and fill it with a formula like =IF(OR(conditionA, conditionB), “Yes”, “No”), where conditionA and conditionB are references to the Yes/No values in the Condition A and Condition B columns. Then you can filter on Yes in this last column to obtain the desired results.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now that you know the possibilities, here is one particular filter you can try. Suppose HyTex wants information about all middle-aged married customers with at least two children who have above average salaries, own their own home, and live in Indiana or Kentucky. You should be able to create this filter in a few seconds. The result, sorted in decreasing order of Amount Spent and shown in Figure 2.31, indicates that the average salary for these 10 customers is $84,750, and their total amount spent at HyTex is $14,709. (We summarized Salary by average and Amount Spent by sum in the total row.)</p>
