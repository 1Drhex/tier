(a) Q Consultancy is a related party because a relative of a member of the board of directors owns the entity. This creates the possibility that the contract may have been awarded to Q Consultancy because of favouritism or that the report’s findings could have been influenced by the consultant’s wife.<br /> H is a related party because an individual who holds more than 20 per cent of the entity’s share capital is in a position to exercise significant influence over the entity. The fact that H is a major supplier has no direct relevance in itself to the entity’s status as a related party.<br /> (b) The transactions will have to be disclosed if they are deemed to be material. We do not have sufficient information to tell whether the fee paid to Q Consultancy is material in terms of its size. It is, however, likely to be material to the consultancy.<br /> Furthermore, the nature of the service provided is such that the readers might feel that they should be informed that the consultancy was awarded to a related party.<br /> Even though the cost of the contract may be insignificant to a large entity, the implications of an investigation into the entity’s marketing policies could have farreaching consequences for profitability. It is, therefore, important that the shareholders are informed of this transaction so that they can consider whether the consultancy was well advised.<br /> The purchases from H are probably material in quantitative terms. It is very likely that they will have to be disclosed by V because the shareholders will want to be assured that the purchases have been to the benefit of their entity. The fact that H charged its normal, arm’s length price does not necessarily mean that the price was the best available or that H was the most suitable supplier.<br /> In both cases, the statements should disclose:<br /> ● the fact that Q Consultancy is owned by the husband of a director and H by a major shareholder;<br /> ● descriptions of the transactions;<br /> ● any amounts outstanding at the year end;<br /> ● pricing policies.</p>
