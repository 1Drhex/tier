To solve this problem, you apply Kirchhoff’s voltage law to enough closed loops and apply Kirchhoff’s current law to enough junctions that you end up with enough equations to counterbalance the unknowns. After that, it is simply a matter of doing some algebra. Figure 2.66 illustrates how to apply the laws in order to set up the final equations.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In Fig. 2.66, there are six equations and six unknowns. According to the rules of algebra, as long as you have an equal number of equations and unknowns, you can usually figure out what the unknowns will be. There are three ways we can think of to solve for the unknowns in this case. First, you could apply the old “plug and chug” method, better known as the substitution method, where you combine all the equations together and try to find a single unknown, and then substitute it back into another equation, and so forth. A second method, which is a lot cleaner and perhaps easier, involves using matrices. A book on linear algebra will tell you all you need to know about using matrices to solve for the unknown.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A third method that we think is useful—practically speaking—involves using a trick with determinants and Cramer’s rule. The neat thing about this trick is that you do not have to know any math—that is, if you have a mathematical computer program or calculator that can do determinants. The only requirement is that you be able to plug numbers into a grid (determinant) and press “equals.” We do not want to spend too much time on this technique, so we will simply provide you with the equations and use the equations to find one of the solutions to the resistor circuit problem. See Fig. 2.67a.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For example, you can find Δ for the system of equations from the resistor problem by plugging all the coefficients into the determinant and pressing the “evaluate” button on the calculator or computer. See Fig. 2.67b.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, to find, say, the current through <span class="tex-text">\(R_{5}\)</span> and the voltage across it, you find Δ<span class="tex-text">\(I_{5}\)</span>, then use <span class="tex-text">\(I_{5}\)</span> = Δ<span class="tex-text">\(I_{5}\)</span>/Δ to find the current. Then you use Ohm’s law to find the voltage. Figure 2.67c shows how it is done.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To solve for the other currents (and voltages), simply find the other ΔI’s and divide by Δ.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The last approach, as you can see, requires a huge mathematical effort to get a single current value. For simplicity, you can find out everything that’s going on in the circuit by running it through a circuit simulator program. For example, using MultiSim, we get the results in Fig. 2.68:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Plugging the results back into the diagram, you can see Kirchhoff’s voltage in action, as shown in Fig. 2.69. Take any loop, sum the changes in voltage across components, and you get 0 (note that the voltages indicated in black shadow represent point voltages relative to 0-V reference ground). Also, the current that enters any junction will equal the sum of the currents exiting the junction, and vice versa—Kirchhoff’s current law.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Now, before you get too gung ho about playing with equations or become lazy by grabbing a simulator, you should check out a special theorem known as Thevenin’s theorem. This theorem uses some very interesting tricks to analyze circuits, and it may help you avoid dealing with systems of equations or having to resort to simulation. Thevenin’s theorem utilizes something called the superposition theorem, which we must consider first.</p>
