            <p class="blog">Two brothers, Gerald and Henry, own the Edwards Service Company in St. Johns, Newfoundland. It provides onshore services for spent lubricants from North Atlantic offshore platforms. The company needs immediate cash fow. Because the Edwards have an excellent reputation among major oil producers, they have been offered an 8-year contract that pays $200,000 total with 50% upfront and 50% at the end of the suggested 8-year contract. The estimated annual cost for Edwards to provide the services is $30,000. Assume you are the financial person for Edwards. Is the project justified if the brothers want to make at least 8% per year? Use spreadsheet functions and charts to perform a thorough ROR analysis.</p>

The spreadsheet analysis can be accomplished in several ways, some more thorough than others. The four approaches illustrated here are of increasing thoroughness</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Refer to Figure 6.7 (left). The easiest and quickest approach is to develop the RATE function for n=8, A= $-30,000, P =$100,000, and F= $100,000 in a single cell. The value <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span>=15.91% is displayed. The project is definitely justified since MARR 8%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Refer to Figure 6.7 (right). Alternatively, to obtain the same answer, enter the years and associated net cash flows in consecutive cells. Develop the IRR function for the 9 entries to display <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span>= 15.91%; the project is justified.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Refer to Figure 6.8 (top). The cash flow (upper left of the figure) is a nonconventional series with two sign changes. The cumulative series has one sign change, indicating that a unique nonnegative <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span> exists. This is 15.91%, displayed when the function =IRR(B3:B11) is input. However, as predicted by the rule of signs, there is a second, though negative, <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span>value at -23.98% found by using the guess option. A variety of guess percentages.</p>
 <p class="blog">
can be used; Figure 6.8 shows only four, but the results will always be <span class="tex-text">\(i_{1}^{*}\)</span> =23.98% and <span class="tex-text">\(i_{2}^{*}\)</span>= 15.91%.</p>
 <p class="blog">

Is the project justified, knowing there are two roots? If reinvestment can be assumed to be at 15.91% rather than the MARR of 8%, the project is justified. If released funds are actually expected to make 8%, the project’s return is between 8 and 15.91%, and it is still justified. However, if funds are actually expected to make less than the MARR, it is not justified because the true rate is less than MARR, in fact between MARR and -23.98%. The conclusion is that the ROR analysis does not provide a conclusive answer. If reinvestment is not assumed at either <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span>value, the procedure of Section 6.7 should be performed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Refer to Figure 6.8 (bottom). An excellent graphical way to approximate <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span> values is to generate an x-y scatter chart of PW versus <span class="tex-text">\(i\)</span> . Use the NPV function with different <span class="tex-text">\(i\)</span>values to determine where the PW curve crosses the PW =0 line. Here<span class="tex-text">\(i\)</span> values from- 30% to +30% were chosen. For details, refer to the cell tags for the NPV function formats using the cash flows entered at the top of the figure and different <span class="tex-text">\(i\)</span> values. The approximate <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span><br /> values are -25% and +15%. Basically, this graphical analysis provides the same information as that of (3).</p>

Comment: Don’t make the mistake of thinking that the MIRR (modified IRR) spreadsheet function performs the same ROR analysis on nonconventional series as that which determines the unique composite rate <span class="tex-text">\(\acute{i}\)</span> as described in Section 6.7.<br /> The answer displayed using MIRR is not the <span class="tex-text">\(\acute{i}\)</span> value, except in the unique situation that both MIRR rates (loan finance rate and positive cash flow reinvestment rate) happen to be the same and this value is exactly one of the roots of the ROR relation. For Example 6.11, Figure 6.8, using the function MIRR(B3:B11, 15.91%,15.91%), will display <span class="tex-text">\(i^{*}\)</span> 15.91%. So it is necessary to know the answer up-front and assume that reinvestment is at this rate to get the unique answer; not a likely situation!</p>
