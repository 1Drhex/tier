            <p class="blog">JB Limited is a small specialist manufacturer of electronic components. Makers of aircraft, for both civil and military purposes, use much of its output. One of the aircraft makers has offered a contract to JB Limited for the supply, over the next 12 months, of 400 identical components. The data relating to the production of each component are as follows:</p> <p class="blog">(i) Material requirements:<br /> 3 kg of material M1 (see note 1 below)<br /> 2 kg of material P2 (see note 2 below)<br /> 1 bought-in component (part number 678) (see note 3 below)<br /> Note 1: Material M1 is in continuous use by the business; 1,000 kg are currently held by the business. Their original cost was £4.70/kg, but it is known that future purchases will cost £5.50/kg.<br /> Note 2: 1,200 kg of material P2 are currently held. The original cost of this material was £4.30/kg. The material has not been required for the last two years. Its scrap value is £1.50/kg. The only foreseeable alternative use is as a substitute for material P4 (in constant use) but this would involve further processing costs of £1.60/kg. The current cost of material P4 is £3.60/kg.</p> <p class="blog">Note 3: It is estimated that the component (part number 678) could be bought in for £50 each.</p> <p class="blog">(ii) Labour requirements: Each component would require five hours of skilled labour and five hours of semi-skilled. A skilled employee is available and is currently paid £14/hour. A replacement would, however, have to be obtained at a rate of £12/hour for the work, which would otherwise be done by the skilled employee. The current rate for semi-skilled work is £10/hour and an additional employee could be appointed for this work.</p> <p class="blog">(iii) General manufacturing costs: It is JB Limited’s policy to charge a share of the general costs (rent, heating, and so on) to each contract undertaken at the rate of £20 for each machine-hour used on the contract. If the contract is undertaken, the general costs are expected to increase as a result of undertaking the contract by £3,200.</p> <p class="blog">Spare machine capacity is available and each component would require four machine hours. A price of £200 a component has been offered by the potential customer.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong>:<br /> (a) Should the contract be accepted? Support your conclusion with appropriate figures to present to management.<br /> (b) What other factors ought management to consider that might influence the decision?</p>

Clearly, on the basis of the information available it would be beneficial for the business to undertake the contract.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) There is an almost infinite number of possible answers to this part of the question, including:</p>
 <ul> <li>If material P2 had not already been held, it may be that it would not be possible to buy it in and still leave the contract as a beneficial one. In this case the business may be unhappy about accepting a price under the particular conditions that apply, which could not be accepted under other conditions.</li> <li>Will the replacement for the skilled worker be able to do the normal work of that person to the necessary standard?</li> <li>Is JB Limited confident that the additional unskilled employee can be made redundant at the end of this contract without cost to itself?</li> </ul>
