            <p class="blog"><strong>A Graph-Matching Game: Using a Motion Detector to Analyze Motion</strong></p> <p class="blog">motion detector (or sonic ranger) is a device that uses ultrasound to measure the position of objects (Figure 3-20(a)). If an object is moving along a straight line, then a single motion detector is sufficient to determine its location. A motion detector is a “digital bat,” as it uses <strong>echolocation</strong> to determine where objects are in space and then deduce how they are moving. Echolocation uses the time it takes a sound pulse emitted from a detector to reflect off an object and return to the detector to determine the distance from the object to the detector. Since a motion detector can detect sound pulses many times a second, it can provide ample data about an object’s motion. Accompanying software, such as Logger Pro, can visualize these data points by plotting real-time x(t), <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}(t), \text { and } a_{x}(t)\)</span> graphs. A student is asked to walk in front of the motion detector (Figure 3-20(a)) to match the given x(t) graph shown in Figure 3-20(b). Provided that the positive x-axis is directed away from the motion detector toward the student, and the origin of the x-axis by default is located inside the motion detector, answer the following question about each one of the four segments of the given x(t) plot.</p> <p class="blog">(a) Describe how the student has to move to match the graph, including her initial position, velocity, and acceleration.</p> <p class="blog">(b) Plot corresponding <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}(t) \text { and } a_{x}(t)\)</span> graphs for each one of the segments.</p> <p class="blog">(c) What are the student’s displacement and distance during her trip?</p> <p class="blog">(d) What are the student’s average velocity and average speed during her trip?</p>

Since the position versus time plot consists of five linear segments, the student should walk with constant but different velocities in each one of these segments. Since the velocities are constant, the acceleration of the student is always zero (except at the brief instants when her motion changes, but we will not include those instants in this discussion and instead focus on the segments themselves). Since the slope of the x(t) graph represents the student’s velocity, we can find the slope within each one of the segments. Positive slope indicates that the student should be moving away from the detector, while negative slope means that she needs to move toward the detector. A zero slope means that the student should remain motionless (zero velocity). Notice, since the position versus time graph of her motion is represented by straight line segments, the velocities during each one of the five time intervals must be constant. Therefore, the accelerations of the girl during each one of the segments must be zero.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) Description of student’s motion:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Segment I: </strong>The student starts from the point located 3.0 m from the front of the motion detector <span class="tex-text">\(\left(x_{0}=3.0 m \right)\)</span> and walks in the negative direction (toward the motion detector) with a constant velocity of</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(v_{ I }=\frac{1.5 m -3.0 m }{3.0 s }=-0.50 m / s\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Segment II: </strong>The student is not moving; she is standing still for 1.5 s at the location <span class="tex-text">\(x_{ II }=1.5 m\)</span> from 3.0 s to 4.0 s. Therefore, her velocity is zero: <span class="tex-text">\(v_{ II }=0 m / s\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Segment III: </strong>The student is walking with constant velocity toward the motion detector (in the negative x-direction) from the point located 1.5 m in front of the motion detector to the point located 0.5 m in front of the detector.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Her velocity is <span class="tex-text">\(v_{ III }=\frac{0.5 m -1.5 m }{1.0 s }=-1.0 m / s\)</span> .</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Segment IV: </strong>The student is once again not moving; she is standing still for 2.0 s at the location <span class="tex-text">\(x_{ IV }=0.05 m\)</span> from 5.0 s to 7.0 s. Therefore, her velocity is zero: <span class="tex-text">\(v_{ IV }=0 m / s\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Segment V: </strong>The student starts walking with constant velocity in the positive x-direction (away from the motion detector) from the point located 0.50 m from the motion detector to the point located 3.0 m from the motion detector. She walks for 3.0 s (from 7.0 s to 10.0 s). Her velocity is</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(v_{ V }=\frac{3.0 m -0.5 m }{3.0 s }=0.83 m / s\)</span> .</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) We will plot the x(t) and <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}(t)\)</span> graphs in a stacked format (Figure 3-21), so they have aligned time axes indicated by the vertical dashed lines. The <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x}(t)\)</span> graph of the student’s motion is plotted based on the answers from part (a).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) To find the student’s displacement during the trip, we note where she started and where she ended her walk. Since she started at <span class="tex-text">\(x_{0}=3.0 m\)</span> and finished at the same position, her displacement is zero: <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x=0 m\)</span>. However, the distance she travelled is not zero. She walked 2.5 m toward the detector during segments <strong>I</strong> and <strong>III</strong> and then 2.5 m away from the detector during segment <strong>V</strong>, so her total distance travelled is 5.0 m.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) Since she completed her walk in 10.0 s, her average velocity is zero and her average speed is 0.50 m/s, as shown below:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_{x, avg }=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{0 m }{10.0 s }=0 m / s\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(v_{ avg }=\frac{d}{\Delta t}=\frac{5.0 m }{10.0 s }=0.50 m / s\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the average speed is not equal to the average of the five speeds, as the student was moving at different speeds over different time intervals. However, based on its definition (Equation 3-3), the average speed defines how fast the student should move with a constant speed (0.50 m/s in this case) to cover the overall distance in the overall time (10.0 s). Also, note<br /> that if you tried walking in front of the motion detector, you would notice that in real life it is impossible to “jump” from one velocity to another without accelerating. This problem is a simplified version of a more realistic scenario where you are sometimes walking with variable velocity both in direction and in magnitude and sometimes walking with constant velocity.</p>
