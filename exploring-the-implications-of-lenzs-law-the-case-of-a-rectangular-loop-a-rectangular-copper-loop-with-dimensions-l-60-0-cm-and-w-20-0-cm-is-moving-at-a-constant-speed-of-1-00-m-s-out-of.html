(a) Let us consider each side of the loop. When the loop is stationary and there is no electric current flowing in it, the charged particles inside the loop have zero average velocity (their drift velocity is equal to zero). However, when the loop is moving to the right with a constant velocity of 1.00 m/s the charges inside the loop start moving to the right as well. These charges are also moving with an average velocity of 1.00 m/s (Figure 25-7(a)). Since they are moving inside the region of a constant magnetic field, these charges will experience a magnetic force described by Equation 24-1. As a result, positive charges will experience a magnetic force directed upward, while negative charges will experience a downward magnetic force. We have already considered a similar case when discussing the Hall effect in Section 24-3. This charge separation will be the most pronounced inside side BC, which is directed perpendicular to both the magnetic field, <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ B }\)</span>, and the velocity, <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ v }\)</span>. This charge separation will induce an electric current in the loop in the clockwise direction. Now we can consider the effect of this induced current on each side of the loop. We will use Equation 24-21, which describes the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire, to find the forces acting on each side of the loop.</p>

The only force applied on it is the external force <span class="wp-katex-eq" data-display="false">\)</span>\overrightarrow{ F }_{ ext }</span> pulling the loop outside of the magnetic field region.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) The force acting on side CD can be found using Equation 24-19 describing the Hall potential difference <span class="tex-text">\(\left(\Delta V_{\text {Hall }}=\right.\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(v B w)\)</span> and the magnetic force on the current-carrying wire <span class="tex-text">\(\text { (Equation 24-21: } \overrightarrow{ F }_{B}=I\overrightarrow{ \ell } \times \overrightarrow{ B } \text { ): }\)</span></p>

 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}F_{ CD } &amp;=I \ell B=\frac{\Delta V_{\text {Hall }}}{R} w B=\frac{v B w}{R} w B=\frac{v}{R}(w B)^{2} \\&amp;=\frac{1.00 m / s }{26.5 m \Omega}((0.200 m )(0.500 T ))^{2} \\&amp;=0.377 N\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
While in this example, the force on side CD is small, it is important to notice that the force is proportional to the square of the magnetic field. Moreover, it is inversely proportional to the resistance of the loop. By decreasing the resistance, we can increase the force. This relationship is important for many applications, such as magnetic brakes, discussed later in this chapter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The direction of the induced electric current, as discussed above, is clockwise, and its magnitude is equal to</p>

&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) According to Newton’s first law, for the loop to move with a constant velocity, the sum of the forces acting on it must balance out: <span class="tex-text">\(\sum \overrightarrow{ F }=0\)</span>. Therefore, the external force pulling on the loop must be equal and opposite to the force on side CD (Figure 25-7(b)): <span class="tex-text">\(\overrightarrow{ F }_{ CD }=-\overrightarrow{ F }_{ ext } \Rightarrow F_{ ext }=3.77 mN\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice that the forces on the horizontal sides of the loop pull in opposite directions and cancel each other.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) To find the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the loop, we use the results from , noting that the change of magnetic flux in this example is caused by the changing area of the loop that is immersed in the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop:</p>
 <p class="blog">

 <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{d \Phi_{ B }}{d t}=\underbrace{\frac{d A(t)}{d t} B \cos \theta}_{A \neq const }=\frac{w \Delta x}{\Delta t} B=w v B=0.100 V\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, we can find the emf induced in the loop (Equation 25-12):</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon_{\text {ind }}=-\left(\frac{d \Phi_{ B }}{d t}\right)_{\text {coil }}=-N\left(\frac{d \Phi_{ B }}{d t}\right)_{\text {loop }}\)</span> {25-12}</p>

 <p class="blog">
To interpret the meaning of the negative sign, we can apply Lenz’s law: the direction of the induced emf should oppose the changes that caused it. Since the loop is moving out of the region of a constant magnetic field, the magnetic flux through it is decreasing. To prevent the decrease, the current induced in the loop should be directed to generate an induced magnetic field in the direction of the original magnetic field. This means that the induced current in the loop will be flowing in the clockwise direction.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) We have considered the case of closed loop moving out of the region of uniform and constant magnetic field from the perspective of magnetic forces acting on moving charges (parts (a) to (c)) and from the perspective of Faraday’s law and magnetic flux. As expected, the two approaches give the same results. The Hall potential difference generated across side BC is precisely equal to the induced emf, according to Faraday’s law: <span class="tex-text">\(\varepsilon_{\text {ind }}=V_{\text {Hall }}=v w B\)</span>. Moreover, this induced potential difference prevents the loops from moving out of the magnetic field. The negative sign in Faraday’s law, which is reflected in Lenz’s law, emphasizes that one needs to do work on the loop (invest energy into the system) to pull the loop out of the magnetic field region. We can understand this because, during the process, electric current is generated and the mechanical energy we invested into moving the loop out is transformed into electromagnetic energy. If not for the opposite sign in Faraday’s law, we could have generated an infinite amount of electromagnetic energy (significant current) from investing a very small amount of mechanical energy into the system (which did not have energy stored in it) by just giving the loop a small initial kick—an initial velocity. Notice that similar reasoning can be applied to explain why the minus sign in Hooke’s law is crucial from the energy conservation standpoint. In summary, if the direction of the induced emf were not opposed to the change of the magnetic flux, we would get a perpetual motion machine arising from the positive feedback. This “runaway” scenario contradicts the law of energy conservation.</p>

<strong>Making sense of the result</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
As mentioned above, we can use different approaches to solve problems where emf and consequently electric current are induced in a loop as a result of changing the magnetic flux through it. Whatever our approach is, our solution should obey Newton’s laws and the law of energy conservation. Moreover, different approaches should lead to the same results. For example, if we imagine a loop moving in a uniform, constant, and infinitely large magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the loop will remain constant. Therefore, no emf will be induced in it. However, the Hall potential difference would still be generated across sides CD and AB of the loop. How can these two approaches be reconciled? To resolve this apparent paradox, we should notice that the Hall potential differences generated across sides CD and AB of the loop in that case will have equal magnitude and opposite signs. Thus, the net Hall potential in the circuit will be zero, which is equivalent to zero induced emf. Remember, the results of the application of different approaches should always be the same, which gives us a chance to see if our solution makes sense.</p>
