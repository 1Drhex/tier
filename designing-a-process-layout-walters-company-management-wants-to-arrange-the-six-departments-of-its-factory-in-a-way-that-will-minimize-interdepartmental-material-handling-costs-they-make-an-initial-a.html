<strong>APPROACH AND SOLUTION</strong> <span class="tex-text">\(\blacktriangleright\)</span> The process layout procedure that they follow involves six steps:<br /> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Construct a “from–to matrix” showing the flow of parts or materials from department to department (see Figure 9.4).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine the space requirements for each department. (Figure 9.5 shows available plant space.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Develop an initial schematic diagram showing the sequence of departments through which parts must move. Try to place departments with a heavy flow of materials or parts next to one another. (See Figure 9.6.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Determine the cost of this layout by using the material-handling cost equation:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cost = \sum\limits^{n}_{i = 1}{\sum\limits^{n}_{j = 1}{X_{ij}C_{ij}}}\)</span> <p class="blog">
For this problem, Walters Company assumes that a forklift carries all interdepartmental loads. The cost of moving one load between adjacent departments is estimated to be $1. Moving a load between nonadjacent departments costs $2. Looking at Figures 9.4 and 9.5, we thus see that the handling cost between departments 1 and 2 is $50 ($1 × 50 loads), $200 between departments 1 and 3 ($2 × 100 loads), $40 between departments 1 and 6 ($2 × 20 loads), and so on. Work areas that are diagonal to one another, such as 2 and 4, are treated as adjacent. The total cost for the layout shown in Figure 9.6 is:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{matrix} Cost = \$ 50 + &amp; \$200+ &amp; \$40+ &amp; \$30+&amp; \$50+ &amp; \$10+ &amp; \$40+ &amp; \$100+&amp; \$50 \\ &amp; (1 and 2) &amp; (1 and 3) &amp; (1 and 6) &amp; (2 and 3)&amp; (2 and 4) &amp; (2 and 5) &amp; (3 and 4) &amp; (3 and 6)&amp; (4 and 5)\end{matrix}=\$570 \)</span> <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 5:</strong> By trial and error (or by a more sophisticated computer program approach that we discuss shortly), try to improve the layout pictured in Figure 9.5 to establish a better arrangement of departments.</p>
 <p class="blog">
By looking at both the flow graph (Figure 9.6) and the cost calculations, we see that placing departments 1 and 3 closer together appears desirable. They currently are nonadjacent, and the high volume of flow between them causes a large handling expense. Looking the situation over, we need to check the effect of shifting departments and possibly raising, instead of lowering, overall costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One possibility is to switch departments 1 and 2. This exchange produces a second departmental flow graph (Figure 9.7), which shows a reduction in cost to $480, a savings in material handling of $90:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{matrix} Cost = \$ 50 + &amp; \$100+ &amp; \$20+ &amp; \$60+&amp; \$50+ &amp; \$10+ &amp; \$40+ &amp; \$100+&amp; \$50 \\ &amp; (1 and 2) &amp; (1 and 3) &amp; (1 and 6) &amp; (2 and 3)&amp; (2 and 4) &amp; (32 and 5) &amp; (3 and 4) &amp; (3 and 6)&amp; (4 and 5)\end{matrix}=\$480 \)</span> <p class="blog">
Suppose Walters Company is satisfied with the cost figure of $480 and the flow graph of Figure 9.7. The problem may not be solved yet. Often, a sixth step is necessary:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Step 6:</strong> Prepare a detailed plan arranging the departments to fit the shape of the building and its nonmovable areas (such as the loading dock, washrooms, and stairways). Often this step involves ensuring that the final plan can be accommodated by the electrical system, floor loads, aesthetics, and other factors.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the case of Walters Company, space requirements are a simple matter (see Figure 9.8).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>INSIGHT</strong> <span class="tex-text">\(\blacktriangleright\)</span> This switch of departments is only one of a large number of possible changes. For a six-department problem, there are actually 720 (or 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) potential arrangements! In layout problems, we may not find the optimal solution and may have to be satisfied with a “reasonable” one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>LEARNING EXERCISE</strong> <span class="tex-text">\(\blacktriangleright\)</span> Can you improve on the layout in Figures 9.7 and 9.8? [Answer: Yes, it can be lowered to $430 by placing Shipping in area A, Painting in area B, Assembly in area C, Receiving in area D (no change), Machine Shop in area E, and Testing in area F (no change).]</p>
