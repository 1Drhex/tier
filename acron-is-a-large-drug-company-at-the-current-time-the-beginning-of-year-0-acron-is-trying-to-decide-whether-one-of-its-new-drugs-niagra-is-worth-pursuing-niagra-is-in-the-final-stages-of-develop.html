            <p class="blog">Acron is a large drug company. At the current time, the beginning of year 0, Acron is trying to decide whether one of its new drugs, Niagra, is worth pursuing. Niagra is in the final stages of development and will be ready to enter the market one year from now. The final cost of development, to be incurred at the beginning of year 1, is $15 million. Acron estimates that the demand for Niagra will gradually grow and then decline over its useful lifetime of 20 years. Specifically, the company expects<br /> its gross margin (revenue minus cost) to be $1.5 million in year 1, then to increase at an annual rate of 6% through year 8, and finally to decrease at an annual rate of 5% through year 20. Acron wants to develop a spreadsheet model of its 20-year cash flows, assuming its cash flows, other than the initial development cost, are incurred at the ends of the respective years. (To simplify the model, taxes are ignored.) Using an annual discount rate of 7.5% for the purpose of calculating NPV, the drug company wants to answer the following questions:<br /> 1. Is the drug worth pursuing, or should Acron abandon it now and not incur the $15 million development cost?<br /> 2. How do changes in the model inputs change the answer to question 1?</p> <p class="blog">Objective<br /> To illustrate efficient selection and copying of large ranges and to learn Excel’s NPV function.</p>

The model of Acron’s cash flows appears in Figure 1.29. As with many financial spreadsheet models that extend over a multiyear period, you enter “typical” formulas in the first year or two and then copy this logic down to all years. (We could make the years go across, not down. In that case, splitting the screen is useful so that you can see the first and last years of data. Splitting the screen is explained in the following Excel Tip.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
To create the model, complete the following steps. (See the file <strong>Calculating NPV Finished.xlsx.)</strong><br /> <strong>1. Inputs and range names.</strong> Enter the given input data in the blue cells, and name the ranges as shown. As usual, the range<br /> names for cells B4 through B9 can be created all at once with the Create from Selection shortcut, as can the range name for<br /> the gross margins in column B. In the latter case, select the range B12:B32 and then use the Create from Selection shortcut.<br /> <strong>2. Cash flows.</strong> Start by entering the formula<br /> <strong>=Gross_margin_year_1</strong><br /> in cell B13 for the year 1 gross margin. Then enter the general formula<br /> <strong>=IF(A14&lt;=Peak_year,B13*(1+Rate_of_increase),B13*(1−Rate_of_decrease))</strong><br /> in cell B14 and copy it down to cell B32 to calculate the other yearly gross margins. Note how this IF function checks the year index in column A to see whether sales are still increasing or have started to decrease. By using the (range-named) input cells in this formula, you can change any of these inputs in cells B6 through B8, and the calculated cells will automatically update. This is a much better practice than embedding the numbers in the formula itself.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>3. Net present value.</strong> The NPV is based on the sequence of cash flows in column B. From the general discussion of NPV, to discount everything back to the beginning of year 1, the value in cell B13 should be multiplied by <span class="tex-text">\(1/(1+r)^{1}\)</span> , the value in cell B14 should be multiplied by <span class="tex-text">\(1/(1+r)^{2}\)</span> , and so on, and these quantities should be summed to obtain the NPV. (Here, r = 0.075 is the discount rate.) Fortunately, however, Excel has a built-in NPV function to accomplish this calculation. To use it, enter the formula<br /> <strong>=−Development_cost1NPV(Discount_rate,Gross_margin)</strong><br /> in cell B33. The NPV function takes two arguments: the discount rate and a range of cash flows. It assumes that the first cell in this range is the cash flow at the end of year 1, the second cell is the cash flow at the end of year 2, and so on. This explains why the development cost is subtracted outside the NPV function—it is incurred at the beginning of year 1. In general, any cash flow incurred at the beginning of year 1 must be placed outside the NPV function so that it won’t be discounted.<br /> Note that the sum of the cash flows in column B is slightly more than $34.54 million, but the NPV (aside from the development cost) is only about $18.06 million. This is because values farther into the future are discounted so heavily. At the extreme, the $1.2188 million cash flow in year 20 is equivalent to only $1.2188 <span class="tex-text">\([1/(1+0.075)^{20} ] = $0.287\)</span> million now.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Deciding Whether to Continue with the Drug<br /> NPV calculations are typically used to see whether a certain project should be undertaken. If the NPV is positive, the project is worth pursuing. If the NPV is negative, the company should look for other places to invest its money. Figure 1.29 shows that the NPV for this drug is positive, over $3.06 million. Therefore, if Acron is comfortable with its predictions of future cash flows, it should continue with the development and marketing of the drug. However, Acron might first want to see how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the sales predictions. After all, these predictions are intelligent guesses at best.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One possible sensitivity analysis appears in Figure 1.30. This shows a one-way data table to see how the NPV changes when the number of years of increase (the input in cell B6) changes. Again, the important question is whether the NPV stays positive. It certainly does when the input variable is greater than its current value of 8. However, if sales start decreasing soon enough—that is, if the value in B6 is 4 or less—the NPV turns negative. This should probably not concern Acron, because its best guess for the years of increase is considerably greater than 4.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another possibility is to see how long and how good the good years are. To do this, you can create the two-way data table shown in Figure 1.31, where cell B7 is the row input cell and cell B6 is the column input cell. Now you can see that if sales increase through year 6, all reasonable yearly increases result in a positive NPV. However, if sales increase only through year 5, then a low enough yearly increase can produce a negative NPV. Acron might want to step back and estimate how likely these bad scenarios are before proceeding with the drug.</p>
