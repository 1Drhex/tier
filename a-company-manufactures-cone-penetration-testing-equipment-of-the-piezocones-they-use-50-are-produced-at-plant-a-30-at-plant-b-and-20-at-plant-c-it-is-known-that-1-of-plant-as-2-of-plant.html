We want to find P [D]. There are at least two possible approaches.</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Approach 1</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
A Venn diagram of the sample space is given in Figure 1.7. The information given in the problem does not allow the Venn diagram to be easily filled in. It is easy to see the event of interest, though, as it has been shaded in. Then</p>

&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Approach 2</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
Recall that when we only had probabilities like P [A] , P [B] , . . . , that is, no conditional probabilities, we found it helpful to represent the probabilities in a Venn diagram. Unfortunately, there is no easy representation of the conditional probabilities in a Venn diagram: (In fact, conditional probabilities are ratios of probabilities that appear in the Venn diagram.) Conditional probabilities find a more natural home on event trees. Event trees must be constructed carefully and adhere to certain rules if they are going to be useful in calculations. Event trees consist of nodes and branches. There is a starting node from which two or more branches leave. At the end of each of these branches there is another node from which more branches may leave (and go to separate nodes). The idea is repeated from the newer nodes as often as required to completely depict all possibilities. A probability is associated with each branch and, for all branches except those leaving the starting node, the probabilities are conditional probabilities. Thus, the event tree is composed largely of conditional probabilities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is one other rule that event trees must obey: Branches leaving any node must form a partition of the sample space. That is, the events associated with each branch must be disjoint—you cannot be on more than one branch at a time—and must include all possibilities. The sum of probabilities of all branches leaving a node must be 1.0. Also keep in mind that an event tree will only be useful if all the branches can be filled with probabilities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The event tree for this example is constructed as follows. The piezocone must first be made at one of the three plants, then depending on where it was made, it could be defective or not. The event tree for this problem is thus as given in Figure 1.8. Note that there are six “paths” on the tree. When a piezocone is selected at random, exactly one of these paths will have been followed—we will be on one of the branches. Recall that interest is in finding P [D]. The event D will have occurred if either the first, third, or fifth path was followed. That is, the probability that the first, third, or fifth path was followed is sought. If the first path is followed, then the event A ∩ D has occurred. This has probability found by multiplying the probabilities along the path,</p>

 <span class="tex-text">\(P [A \cap D]= P [D \mid A] \cdot P [A]=0.01(0.5)=0.005\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Looking back at the calculation performed in Approach 1, P [D] was computed as</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}P [D]=&amp; P [D \mid A] \cdot P [A]+ P [D \mid B] \cdot P [B] \\&amp;+ P [D \mid C] \cdot P [C] \\=&amp; 0.01(0.5)+0.02(0.3)+0.03(0.2) \\=&amp; 0.017\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
which, in terms of the event tree, is just the sum of all the paths that lead to the outcome that you desire, D. Event trees make “total probability” problems much simpler. They give a “picture” of what is going on and allow the computation of some of the desired probabilities directly.</p>
