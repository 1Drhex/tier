With the many numeric variables in the golf data set, it is indeed unwieldy to create scatterplots for all pairs of variables (unless you have an add-in like StatTools), but it is fairly easy to create a table of correlations. You could use Excelâ€™s CORREL function to calculation each correlation, but if there are many variables, the following steps allow you to fill a table of correlations much more quickly. (Refer to Figure 3.18 as you read this.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Highlight all columns of variables to be correlated, including their variable names at the top, and create range names for them with the Create from Selection button on the Formulas ribbon.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Copy the variable names to the top row and left column of your correlation table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. Create a copyable formula involving the CORREL and INDIRECT functions to calculate all correlations in the table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The resulting table of correlations appears in Figure 3.18. The typical formula shown at the bottom was copied to the entire table. The INDIRECT function refers to the range names created in step 1 to get the ranges for the CORREL function. However, note that range names replace illegal characters like / and spaces with underscores. Therefore, the corresponding changes had to be made to the variable names in the table. Also, there are missing data in some of the variables. When calculating the correlation between any two variables, the CORREL function ignores any rows with missing data for these two variables.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can ignore the 1.000 values along the diagonal because a variable is always perfectly correlated with itself. Besides these, you are typically looking for relatively large values, either positive or negative. When the table is fairly large, conditional formatting is useful. For example, you can format all correlations between 0.6 and 0.999 as red and all correlations between 20.999 and 20.5 as green, as has been done here. There are three large positive values, all above 0.69, involving events, rounds, and cuts made. None of these should come as a surprise. There is only one large negative correlation, the one between driving length and driving accuracy, and you already saw the corresponding scatterplot in Figure 3.16. So if you want to know what a correlation of approximately 20.6 really means, you can look at the scatterplot in this figure. It indicates a definite downward trend, but there is still quite a lot of variability around the best-fitting straight line.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You typically scan a table of correlations for the large correlations, either positive or negative. Conditional formatting is useful, especially if the table is a large one.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Again, a correlation is only a summary of a scatterplot. Therefore, you can learn more about any interesting-looking correlations by creating the corresponding scatterplot. For example, the scatterplot corresponding to the 0.888 correlation between Cuts Made and Rounds appears in Figure 3.19. (We also superimposed a trend line.) This chart shows the strong linear relationship between cuts made and rounds played, but it also shows that there is still considerable variability around the best-fitting straight line, even with a correlation as large as 0.888.</p>
