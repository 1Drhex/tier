            <p class="blog">Reactor runaway<br /> (This is a story retold based on Fogler, 1999).<br /> An explosion occurred at Monsanto plant in Sauget, Illinois, on August 8, 1969 at 12:18 am. The blast was heard as far as 10<br /> miles away and people were awakened from their sleep. The culprit was a batch reactor producing nitroanaline from ammonia and o-nitrochlorobenzene (ONCB):</p> <p class="blog">The reaction is normally carried out at 175°C and about 500 psi. The ambient temperature of the cooling water in the heat exchanger is 25°C. The reactor temperature could be changed by adjusting the coolant rate. At the plant setting, the reactor temperature could be maintained at 175°C at the maximum coolant rate if the ambient temperature of 25°C could be maintained throughout the heat exchange.</p> <p class="blog">On the day of the accident, two changes in normal operation occurred:</p> <p class="blog">1. The reactor was charged with 9.044 kmol of ONCB (nearly three times of the normal 3.17 kmol), 33.0 kmol of <span class="tex-text">\(NH _{3}\)</span> (instead of 43 kmol in normal operations) and 103.7 kmol of <span class="tex-text">\( H _{2} O\)</span> (about the same as the normal of 103.6 kmol).</p> <p class="blog">2. The reaction is normally carried out isothermally at 175°C over a 24-h period. Approximately 45 min after the reaction was started, cooling to the reactor was turned off for 10 min. It was not unusual not to cool in that 10 min or so on period when the normal charge of 3.17 kmol of ONCB was used and no ill effects occurred.</p> <p class="blog">The reactor had a safety relief valve with a disk rupture pressure of about 700 psi. Once the disk ruptures, the water would vaporize, and the reaction would be cooled (quenched) by the release of the latent heat of vaporization.</p> <p class="blog">Plot the temperature-time trajectory up to a period of 125 min after the reactants were mixed and brought up to 175°C. Show that the following three conditions had to have been present for the explosion to occur: (1) Increased ONCB charge; (2) Reactor cooling stopped for 10 min; and (3) relief system failure.<br /> Additional information: The reaction rate is</p> <span class="tex-text">\(-r_{\text {ONCB }}=k C_{\text {ONCB }} C_{N H_{3}}, \text { with } k=0.00017 m ^{3} /( kmol \cdot min ) \text { at } 188^{\circ} C\)</span> <p class="blog">The reactant volume for the charge of 9.044 kmol of ONCB is 3.265 <span class="tex-text">\(m ^{3} ONCB / NH _{3}+1.854 m ^{3} H _{2} O =5.119 m ^{3}\)</span>.</p> <p class="blog">The reactant volume for the charge of 3.17 kmol of ONCB is 3.26 <span class="tex-text">\(m ^{3}\)</span>.Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are—<span class="tex-text">\(\Delta H_{R}=-5.9 \times 10^{5} \text { kcal } / kmol - ONCB ; E_{ a }=11.273 kcal / mol ; C_{ P , ONCB }=40 cal /( mol \cdot K ) ; C_{ P , H _{2} O }=18 cal /( mol \cdot K ) ; C _{ P , NH _{3}}=8.38 cal /\)</span>(mol·K).</p> <p class="blog">Assume <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta C_{ P }=0, U A_{ H }=35.85 kcal /\left( min \cdot{ }^{\circ} C \right) \text { with } T_{ a }=298 K\)</span>.</p> <p class="blog">&nbsp;</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/08/16.2.1.png"></div>

 <p class="blog">
The behavior of the reactor can be simulated with Eqs. (E16.2.7) and (E16.2.8).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) Isothermal operation in the first 45 minutes<br /> We first simulate the reaction isothermally at 175°C for the first 45 minutes until the time the cooling was turned off. For isothermal operations, the reaction rate coefficient is constant as it changes only with temperature as shown in Eq. (E16.2.6), k = 0.0001167 <span class="tex-text">\( m ^{3}\)</span>/(kmol·min) at 175°C. Eq. (E16.2.7) can be integrated analytically to yield</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(t=\frac{1}{k\left(C_{B 0}-2 C_{A 0}\right)} \ln \frac{C_{B 0}-2 C_{A 0} f_{A}}{C_{B 0}\left(1-f_{A}\right)}\)</span> (E16.2.11)</p>
 <p class="blog">
or</p>
 <p class="blog">
latex]f_{A}=\frac{1-\exp \left\lfloor k\left(C_{B 0}-2 C_{A 0}\right) t\right\rfloor}{2 C_{A 0} / C_{B 0}-\exp \left\lfloor k\left(C_{B 0}-2 C_{A 0}\right) t\right\rfloor }[/latex] (E16.2.12)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Substituting the parameters, one obtains <span class="tex-text">\(f_{ A }\)</span>= 0.0336 at t = 45 min.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At exactly 45 min, the heat of generation as defined by Eq. (E16.2.10) is given by</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(H_{ G }=\left(-r_{ A } V \right)\left(-\Delta H_{ R }\right)=3882 kcal / min\)</span> <p class="blog">
The maximum cooling available for the heat of removal</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(H_{R, \max }=U A_{H}\left(T-T_{a}\right) \leq 35.85 \times(175-25) kcal / min =5377.5 kcal / min\)</span> <p class="blog">
which is more than sufficient to control the temperature in the reactor. One can conclude that the explosion would not have happened if the cooling was not turned off.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Adiabatic operation for the next 10 minutes</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cooling was turned off from the time of 45 55 minutes. We now solve Eqs. (E16.2.7) and (E16.2.8) with ODEXLims, noting that the initial conditions are</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(t=45 min ; f_{ A }=0.0336 ; T=175+273.15 K\)</span> <p class="blog">
and <span class="tex-text">\(U A_{H}=0\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At the end of the 55 minutes, the solution is given by <span class="tex-text">\(f_{ A }\)</span> = 0.0430 and T = 468.16 K = 190°C. Correspondingly, <span class="tex-text">\(H_{ G }\)</span> = 6569.4 kcal/ min and HR,max = 6094.8 kcal/min. The point of no return has already reached for the reactor is set to fail should it continue to operate. The temperature is going to rise even if maximum cooling is applied from this point on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) Batch operation with heat exchange</p>
 <p class="blog">
Continuing the simulation from part b), but let <span class="tex-text">\(U A_{H}\)</span> = 35.85 kcal/(min·°C). The reactor conditions at the end of the adiabatic operations become the initial conditions for the batch operation with cooling capacity back online. The initial conditions to be used with the ODEXLims are</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(t=55 min ; f_{ A }=0.043009 ; T=468.1589 K\)</span> <p class="blog">
and <span class="tex-text">\(U A_{H}=35.85 kcal /\left( min \cdot{ }^{\circ} C \right)\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Fig. E16.2.2 shows the simulated temperature profile for the reactor operation. We can observe that the temperature continue to rise. More clearly, from Fig. E16.2.3, by 110 minutes (or 10:45 pm), the reactor temperature had reached 515.49 K or 242.3°C.<br /> The temperature began increasing even more rapid after this point. One can observe that 120 min after the batch reactor was started the temperature increases sharply and the reactor explodes at a few minutes before midnight. If the mass and heat capacity of the stirrer and reaction vessel had been included, <span class="tex-text">\(\Sigma n_{ i } C_{ Pi }\)</span> term would have increased by about 5% and extended the time until the explosion occur by 15 minutes or so, which would predict the actual time of the explosion occurred at 12:18 am.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When the temperature reached 300°C, a secondary reaction, the decomposition of nitroaniline to noncondensable gases such CO, <span class="tex-text">\(N _{2} \text { and } NO _{2}\)</span>, occurs, releasing even more heat. The total energy released was estimated to be 6.8 × <span class="tex-text">\(10^{9}\)</span> J, which is enough energy to lift the entire 2500 Mg building 277 m straight up.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) Disk rupture<br /> The pressure relief disk should have ruptured when the temperature reached 265°C or 538.15 K (ca. 700 psi), but it did not and temperature continued to rise. If it had ruptured, the liquid water would vaporize, a maximum of <span class="tex-text">\(10^{6}\)</span> kcal would be able to be drawn from the reaction mixture, thereby lowering the temperature and quenching it.<br /> If the disk had ruptured at 265°C (700 psi), the maximum mass flow rate out of the 2-in orifice to the atmosphere (1 atm) would have been 830 kg/min at the time of rupture. This leads to a maximum heat removal of</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Q=m \Delta H_{\text {vap }}+U A_{H}\left(T-T_{a}\right)=830 kg / min \times 540 kcal / kg +35.85 kcal / K \times(265-25)\)</span> <p class="blog">
= 456804kcal/ min</p>
 <p class="blog">
which is much greater that the heat generation at that time <span class="tex-text">\(H _{ G }\)</span> = 26520.8 kcal/min. The reaction could have easily been quenched.</p>
