<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> A required service period of infinity may be assumed if we anticipate that an investment project will be ongoing at roughly the same level of production for some indefinite period. This assumption certainly is possible mathematically although the analysis is likely to be complicated and tedious. Therefore, in the case of an indefinitely ongoing investment project, we typically select a finite analysis period by using the lowest common multiple of project lives (15 years). We would consider alternative A through five life cycles and alternative B through three life cycles; in each case, we would use the alternatives completely. We then accept the finite model’s results as a good prediction of the economically wisest course of action for the foreseeable future. This example is a case in which we conveniently use the lowest common multiple of project lives as our analysis period. (See Figure 6.7. )</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Model A:</strong><br /> • For a three-year period (first cycle):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{first cycle}\)</span> = -$150,000 &#8211; $55,000 (P/A,15%,3) + $15,000 (P/F,15%,3)<br /> = -$265,715.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">AEC(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{first cycle}\)</span> = $265,715(A/P,15%,3)<br /> = $116,377.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• For a 15-year period (five replacement cycles):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{15-year period}\)</span> = -$265,715[1 + (P/F,15%,3)<br /> + (P/F,15%,6) + (P/F,15%,9) + (P/F,15%,12)]<br /> = -$680,499.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">AEC(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{15-year period}\)</span> = $680,499(A/P,15%,15)<br /> = $116,377.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Model B:</strong><br /> • For a five-year life (first cycle):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{first cycle}\)</span> = -$230,000 &#8211; $30,000(P/A,15%,5) + $35,000(P/F,15%,5)<br /> = -$313,163.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">AEC(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{first cycle}\)</span> = $313,163(A/P,15%,5)<br /> = $93,422.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• For a 15-year period (three replacement cycles):</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">PW(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{15-year period}\)</span>= -$313,163 [1 + (P/F,15%,5) + (P/F,15%,10) ]<br /> = -$546,270.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">AEC(15%)<span class="tex-text">\(_{15-year period}\)</span>= $546, 2701(A/P,15%,15)<br /> = $93, 422.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We can see that the AE cost of Model A is much higher ($116,377 &gt; $93,422); thus, we select Model B, despite its higher initial cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> Notice that the AE costs calculated on the basis of the lowest common multiple period are the same as those that were obtained over the initial life spans. Thus, for alternatives with unequal lives, comparing the AE cost of each project over its first cycle is sufficient in determining the best alternative.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>METHODOLOGY </strong><br /> Our objective is to determine the AE cost of each model over the lowest common multiple period of 15 years. In doing so, we will compute the PW cost of the first cycle, and then we convert it into its equivalent AE cost. We do the same for the entire cycle.</p>
