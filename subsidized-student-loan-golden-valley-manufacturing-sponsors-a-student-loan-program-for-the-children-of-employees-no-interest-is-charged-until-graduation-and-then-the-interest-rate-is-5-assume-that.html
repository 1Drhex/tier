            <p class="blog">Subsidized Student Loan<br /> Golden Valley Manufacturing sponsors a student loan program for the children of employees. No interest is charged until graduation, and then the interest rate is 5%. Assume that George borrows $8000 per year at the beginnings of years 1 through 4 and that he graduates at the end of year 4. If equal annual payments are made at the ends of years 5 through 9, what is the internal rate of return for George’s loan? Is this attractive to George?</p>

The first step is to calculate the five equal annual payments. When he graduates, he owes $32,000, because no interest has been charged. The first payment is due 1 year after graduation, so each payment is:<br /> A = $32,000(A/P, 5%, 5) = 32K × .2310 = $7392<br /> The cash flow series for the subsidized loan is:</p>

 <p class="blog">
Solving for the IRR for this loan is perhaps most easily done by using t = 4 as the equivalence point. The first two interest rates used are 0% (because it is easy) and 3% (because the subsidized rate will be below the 5% that is charged after graduation). The equivalent value, <span class="tex-text">\(F_{4}\)</span>, at the end of year 4 is a function of i.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Setting this equal to zero gives the equation where i = IRR. It is slightly simpler to use (1 + i) rather than the 1-year (F/P) factor:<br /> 0 = 8000(F/A,IRR,4)(1 + IRR) – 7392(P/A,IRR ,5)<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{4}\)</span>(0%) = 8000 × 4 – 7392 × 5 = –$4960<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{4}\)</span>(3%) = 8000 × 4.184 × 1.03 – 7392 × 4.580 = $620.8</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since <span class="tex-text">\(F_{4}\)</span> has opposite signs for 0% and 3%, there is a value of i between 0% and 3% that is the IRR. Because the value for 3% is closer to 0, the IRR will be closer to 3%. Try 2% next:<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{2}\)</span>(2%) = 8000 × 4.122 × 1.02 × 7392 × 4.713 = –$1203.0</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F_{4}\)</span>(2%) is negative, and F4(3%) is positive. Interpolating between 2% and 3% leads to:<br /> IRR = 2% + 1%(1203/(1203 + 620.8)) = 2.6596% or 2.7%<br /> The exact value is IRR = 2.66% This rate is quite low, and it makes the loan look like a good choice.</p>
