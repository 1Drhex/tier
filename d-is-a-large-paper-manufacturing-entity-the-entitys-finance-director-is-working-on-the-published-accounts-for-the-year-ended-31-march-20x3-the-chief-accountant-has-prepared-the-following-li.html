            <p class="blog">D is a large paper manufacturing entity. The entity’s finance director is working on the published accounts for the year ended 31 March 20X3. The chief accountant has prepared the following list of problems which will have to be resolved before the statements can be finalised:<br /> (a) Events occurring after the balance sheet date (IAS 10)<br /> A fire broke out at the entity’s Westown factory on 4 April 20X3. This has destroyed the factory’s administrative block. Many of the costs incurred as a result of this fire are uninsured.<br /> A major customer went into liquidation on 27 April 20X3. The customer’s balance at 31 March 20X3 remains unpaid. The receiver has intimated that unsecured payables will receive very little compensation, if any.<br /> (b) Possible development expenditure (IAS 38)<br /> The entity paid the engineering department at Northtown University a large sum of money to design a new pulping process which will enable the use of cheaper raw materials. This process has been successfully tested in the university’s laboratories and is almost certain to be introduced at D’s pulping plant within the next few months.<br /> The entity paid a substantial amount to the university’s biology department to develop a new species of tree which could grow more quickly and therefore enable the entity’s forests to generate more wood for paper manufacturing. The project met with some success in that a new tree was developed. Unfortunately, it was prone to disease and the cost of the chemical sprays needed to keep the wood healthy rendered the tree uneconomic.<br /> (c) Possible contingent liabilities (IAS 37)<br /> One of the entity’s employees was injured during the year. He had been operating a piece of machinery which had been known to have a faulty guard. The entity’s lawyers have advised that the employee has a very strong case, but will be unable to estimate likely financial damages until further medical evidence becomes available. One of the entity’s customers is claiming compensation for losses sustained as a result of a delayed delivery. The customer had ordered a batch of cut sheets with the intention of producing leaflets to promote a special offer. There was a delay in supplying<br /> the paper and the leaflets could not be prepared in time. The entity’s lawyers have advised that there was no specific agreement to supply the goods in time for this promotion and, furthermore, that it would be almost impossible to attribute the failure of the special offer to the delay in the supply of the paper.<br /> Requirement<br /> Explain how each of these matters should be dealt with in the published accounts for the year ended 31 March 20X3 in the light of the accounting standards referred to above. You should assume that the amounts involved are material in every case.</p>

(a) IAS 10 deals with events after the balance sheet date which may have an effect on the financial statements in question.<br /> The fire in the administration block is a non-adjusting event, as it concerns conditions which did not exist at the balance sheet date. Because of its size and nature, it does require disclosure by way of a note to the accounts in order to avoid the accounts being misleading.<br /> The liquidation of a major customer is an example of an adjusting event, since it provides additional evidence of conditions existing at the balance sheet date. Adjusting events require changes to be made to the amounts included in the financial statements, and so D should write off the bad debt in the accounts for the year ended 31 March 20X3.<br /> (b) IAS 38 identifies different types of expenditure on research and development, and outlines the appropriate accounting treatment for each type. All expenditure on research should be written off as it is incurred, and should not be treated as an asset. Expenditure on the development of new products must be deferred and carried forward in the balance sheet where certain condition are met.<br /> The costs involved in the design of the new pulping process can be carried forward to future periods, as the criteria outlined in IAS 38 appear to be satisfied: the project is clearly defined, the related expenditure is identifiable, and the project is technically feasible and commercially viable. The total amount of expenditure should therefore be included in the balance sheet under intangible non-current assets.<br /> The expenditure involved in the project to develop a new species of tree should be written off in the income statement. It is obviously not a commercially viable product, and its related costs will not be covered by its related revenues.<br /> (c) IAS 37 requires that a material contingent loss should be accrued in the accounts where the loss can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. In the case of the injury to the entity’s employee, although it is likely that the entity will have to pay damages, it is impossible to estimate the amount. As the directors cannot create a provision for this item, they should disclose the matter by way of a note to the accounts. This should include a description of the facts, but should not be worded in such a way as to indicate that the entity accepts liability.<br /> When a contingency has only a remote chance of having a material effect on the financial statements, IAS 37 does not require that it be disclosed in the financial statements. As the entity lawyers have indicated that there is very little likelihood of the customer’s claim being successful, the directors need not mention this compensation claim, even by way of a note to the accounts.</p>
