            <p class="blog">Manufacturing and Distributing Fertilizer at Green Grass</p> <p class="blog">The Green Grass Company manufactures and distributes a fertilizer product. The company sells its product to high-volume customers in various U.S. cities where it has manufacturing plants, but it can decide to operate only some of these plants in any given month. The fixed monthly cost for operating any plant is $60,000, the plant capacity for any operating plant is 2500 pounds per month, and the production cost at any operating plant is $10.25 per pound. After the product is manufactured, it is shipped to customers at a rate of $0.02 per pound per mile. The cities and the distances between them are listed in Table 6.7. The customers submit order sizes and price bids to Green Grass, as listed in Table 6.8. For example, the customer in Boston requires an order of 1430 pounds this month and is willing to pay $75,740 for it. Green Grass can decide to fill this order or not. If not, you can assume that the customer takes its business to another company. For the current month, Green Grass must decide which plants to operate and which customers to service from which operating plants to maximize its monthly profit.</p> <p class="blog">Table 6.7 Distances between Cities for the Green Grass Example:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" border="0" width="864" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Phoenix</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">New York</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Miami</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Los Angeles</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Denver</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Dallas</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Chicago</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Boston</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72"></td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">2664</td> <td dir="LTR">213</td> <td dir="LTR">1539</td> <td dir="LTR">3036</td> <td dir="LTR">1991</td> <td dir="LTR">1815</td> <td dir="LTR">983</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">Boston</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">1729</td> <td dir="LTR">840</td> <td dir="LTR">1390</td> <td dir="LTR">2112</td> <td dir="LTR">1050</td> <td dir="LTR">1205</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">983</td> <td dir="LTR">Chicago</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">1027</td> <td dir="LTR">1604</td> <td dir="LTR">1332</td> <td dir="LTR">1425</td> <td dir="LTR">801</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">1205</td> <td dir="LTR">1815</td> <td dir="LTR">Dallas</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">836</td> <td dir="LTR">1780</td> <td dir="LTR">2041</td> <td dir="LTR">1174</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">801</td> <td dir="LTR">1050</td> <td dir="LTR">1991</td> <td dir="LTR">Denver</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">398</td> <td dir="LTR">2825</td> <td dir="LTR">2757</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">1174</td> <td dir="LTR">1425</td> <td dir="LTR">2112</td> <td dir="LTR">3036</td> <td dir="LTR">Los Angeles</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">2359</td> <td dir="LTR">1258</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">2757</td> <td dir="LTR">2041</td> <td dir="LTR">1331</td> <td dir="LTR">1390</td> <td dir="LTR">1539</td> <td dir="LTR">Miami</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">2442</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">1258</td> <td dir="LTR">2825</td> <td dir="LTR">1780</td> <td dir="LTR">1604</td> <td dir="LTR">840</td> <td dir="LTR">213</td> <td dir="LTR">New York</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR">0</td> <td dir="LTR">2442</td> <td dir="LTR">2359</td> <td dir="LTR">398</td> <td dir="LTR">836</td> <td dir="LTR">1027</td> <td dir="LTR">1729</td> <td dir="LTR">2664</td> <td dir="LTR">Phoenix</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> Table 6.8 Orders and Price Bids for the Green Grass Example:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 333px; height: 250px;" border="0" width="216" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Price</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Quantity</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$75,740</td> <td dir="LTR">1430</td> <td dir="LTR">Boston</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$44,370</td> <td dir="LTR">870</td> <td dir="LTR">Chicago</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$46,320</td> <td dir="LTR">770</td> <td dir="LTR">Dallas</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$87,780</td> <td dir="LTR">1140</td> <td dir="LTR">Denver</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$43,850</td> <td dir="LTR">700</td> <td dir="LTR">Los Angeles</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$21,000</td> <td dir="LTR">830</td> <td dir="LTR">Miami</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$74,850</td> <td dir="LTR">1230</td> <td dir="LTR">New York</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">$83,980</td> <td dir="LTR">1070</td> <td dir="LTR">Phoenix</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To develop a binary model to help Green Grass decide which manufacturing plants to operate and which customer orders to fill from which operating plants.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The distances in Table 6.7 are well known, and the customers can supply the data in Table 6.8.

The variables and constraints for the Green Grass model are shown in Figure 6.30. (See the file Fixed Cost Transportation Big Picture.xlsx.) As in the previous example, there are two sets of binary variables. The first set indicates which plants are open for operation. The second set indicates which customers are supplied by which plants. The “&lt;=1” constraint ensures that no customer is supplied by more than one plant. However, it allows the possibility that the customer is not supplied by any Green Grass plant. The other constraint ensures that no plant produces and ships more than a logical capacity. This logical capacity is 0 if the plant is not opened at all, and it is the 2500-pound limit if the plant is opened. With these decision variables and constraints, the company must decide which plants to open and which customers to supply from which open plants to maximize profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed spreadsheet model appears in Figure 6.31. (See the file Fixed Cost Transportation Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed with the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the inputs in the light blue ranges.<br /> 2) Plant opening decisions. Enter any set of 0’s and 1’s in the Open_plant range. These decision variable cells indicate which plants to open.<br /> 3) Assignment decisions. Enter any set of 0’s and 1’s in the Assignments range. Each decision variable cell in this range indicates whether a particular plant supplies a particular customer.<br /> 4) Plants supplying customers. Each customer can be supplied by at most one plant. To see how many plants are supplying each customer, create row sums of the Assignments range. That is, enter the formula<br /> =SUM(B26:I26)<br /> in cell J26 and copy it down to cell J33. Each such sum is just the number of 1’s in that row of the Assignments range.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Amounts produced at plants. We assume that if a plant is assigned to supply any customer, its production for that customer equals the customer’s order requirement. Then to calculate the total produced (and shipped out) for each plant, enter the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B26:B33,$L$11:$L$18)<br /> in cell B34 for the first plant and copy it across row 34 for the other plants.<br /> 6) Logical plant capacities. If a plant is not open, its capacity is 0. If it is open, its capacity is 2500. To calculate these effective plant capacities, enter the formula<br /> =$B$7*B22<br /> in cell B36 and copy it across row 36. The binary value in this formula reduces effective capacity to 0 or keeps it at 2500. (Note that the logic used here is very similar to the logic in the Great Threads fixed-cost model in. The only difference is that there is now a natural capacity, 2500, in case the plant is opened. In the Great Threads example, we had to calculate a suitable upper limit on production.)<br /> 7) Revenues and variable costs. It is useful to calculate a matrix of revenues and costs for all pairs of cities. To calculate these, enter the formula<br /> =B26*($M11-$L11*($B$4+$B$5*B11))<br /> in cell B41 and copy it to the range B41:I48. The first term in this formula is the binary assignment variable. If it is 0, no revenues or costs are incurred on this route because the route isn’t used. However, if this binary value is 1, the formula subtracts costs from evenue. (Be careful to check the measurement units in these types of calculations. The production cost is pounds multiplied by cost per pound. The shipping cost is pounds multiplied by miles multiplied by cost per pound per mile.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
8)Fixed costs. Each 1 in the Open_plant range adds a fixed cost. To calculate the total fixed cost, enter the formula<br /> =B6*SUM(Open_plant)<br /> in cell B50. This is the number of open plants multiplied by the fixed cost per plant.<br /> 9) Monthly profit. Calculate the monthly profit in cell B51 with the formula<br /> =SUM(B41:I48)-B50</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 6.32. As usual, you should select the Simplex LP method, but you do not really need to check the Non-Negative option because all decision variable cells are constrained to be binary, hence nonnegative. The last constraint ensures that each plant produces nothing if it isn’t open, and no more than its capacity if it is open. The second constraint ensures that each customer’s demand is satisfied by at most one plant. This allows the possibility that a customer’s demand is not satisfied by Green Grass at all.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution in Figure 6.31 indicates that the company should open four plants: Boston (to supply the Boston customer), Denver (to supply the Denver and Dallas customers), New York (to supply the New York and Chicago customers), and Phoenix (to supply the Phoenix and Los Angeles customers). In addition, the model indicates that Green Grass should not supply the Miami customer at all. You can see the main reason for this if you calculate the ratio of order size to price bid for each customer. Miami’s ratio is well below the others. Therefore, it is evidently not profitable to supply the Miami customer.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> One possible sensitivity analysis is to see how much larger Miami’s price bid needs to be before Green Grass supplies it. We tried this, varying Miami’s price bid and keeping track of the row sum in cell J31 that indicates whether Miami is supplied. The results (after some trial and error to find an interesting price bid range) appear in Figure 6.33. When the Miami price bid increases to some value between $31,000 and $32,000, it becomes profitable to supply Miami. (You can check, by rerunning Solver, that Miami is then supplied by New York.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Another possible sensitivity analysis is on the common plant capacity, currently 2500 pounds. The optimal solution in Figure 6.31 indicates that capacity is not currently a constraining factor. Four of the plants are open, and all are operating well under capacity. Therefore, an increase in the common capacity has absolutely no effect, and a slight decrease (down to 2100, the highest plant production) also has no effect. However, any decrease below 2100 should have an effect. This is explored in Figure 6.34, where the common plant capacity is varied and the optimal total fixed cost and profit are outputs. As you can see, if the capacity is below 2100, the total profit decreases. However, the total fixed cost remains constant, at least for this range of capacities. This implies that all of these solutions keep four plants open. How does the optimal solution change? Although the results in Figure 6.34 do not provide the answer, you can rerun Solver with any of these capacities to find out. It turns out that the same four plants stay open but supply fewer customers. For example, when the common capacity is 1500 or 1750, the four plants supply only the customers in their respective cities.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you run these sensitivity analyses with SolverTable, you will immediately notice the longer computing times. These are difficult problems, even for Solver, and you won’t get the immediate solutions you are accustomed to. Each problem has <span class="tex-text">\(2^{72}\)</span> possible binary solutions (because there are 72 binary decision variable cells), which is an enormous number of potential solutions for Solver to sort through with its branch and bound algorithm. Although a binary model of this type and size is still well within Solver’s capabilities, this example should convince you that not all management science optimization models are easy to solve.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. We have assumed that all possible plant locations are in the same cities as the customers. This is not necessary. There could be any number of customers at one set of locations and any other number of plant locations at another set of locations. As long as the distances from each plant to each customer are known, the model changes hardly at all.<br /> 2. We have assumed that the inputs in the range B4:B7 (see Figure 6.31) are constant, the same for each plant or plant–customer pair. This is also not necessary. If these inputs<br /> differ across plants or plant–customer pairs, more input values must be estimated by the cost accountants, but modifications to the model itself are minimal.<br /> 3. We currently assume that the plants in the various locations are already built, and it is just a matter of which to open each month. Suppose instead that the company is expanding and must decide where (or whether) to build new plants. Then there is a one-time fixed cost of building each new plant, in addition to the fixed cost of opening an existing plant in the example. Unfortunately, combining these costs is not a trivial matter. The fixed cost of building must be amortized over some period of time so that it can be combined correctly with the monthly revenues and costs in the current model.</p>
