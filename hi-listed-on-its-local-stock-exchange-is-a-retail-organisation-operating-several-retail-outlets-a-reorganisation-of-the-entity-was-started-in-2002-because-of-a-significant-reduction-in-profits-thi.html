            <p class="blog">Hi, listed on its local stock exchange, is a retail organisation operating several retail outlets. A reorganisation of the entity was started in 2002 because of a significant reduction in profits. This reorganisation was completed during the current financial year. The trial balance for Hi at 30 September 2003 was as follows:<br /> . $000 $000<br /> 10% loan notes (redeemable 2010) 1,000<br /> Retained earnings at 30 September 2002 1,390<br /> Administrative expenses 615<br /> Bank and cash 959<br /> Buildings 11,200<br /> Cash received on disposal of equipment 11<br /> Cost of goods sold 3,591<br /> Distribution costs 314<br /> Equipment and fixtures 2,625<br /> Interest paid on loan notes – half year to 31 March 2003 50<br /> Interim dividend paid 800<br /> Inventory at 30 September 2003 822<br /> Investment income received 37<br /> Non-current asset investments at market value 30 September 2002 492<br /> Ordinary shares of $1 each, fully paid 4,000<br /> Provision for deferred tax 256<br /> Provision for reorganisation expenses at 30 September 2002 1,010<br /> Provisions for depreciation at 30 September 2002:<br /> Buildings 1,404<br /> Equipment and fixtures 1,741<br /> Reorganisation expenses 900<br /> Revaluation reserve 172<br /> Sales revenue 9,415<br /> Share premium 2,388<br /> Trade payables 396<br /> Trade receivables 852<br /> . 23,220 23,220</p> <p class="blog">(i) The reorganisation expenses relate to a comprehensive restructuring and reorganisation of the entity that began in 2002. Hi’s financial statements for 2002 included a provision for reorganisation expenses of $1,010,000. All costs had been incurred by the year end, but an invoice for $65,000, received on 2 October 2003, remained unpaid and is not included in the trial balance figures. No further restructuring and reorganisation costs are expected to occur and the provision is no longer required.<br /> (ii) Non-current asset investments are carried in the financial statements at market value. The market value of the non-current asset investments at 30 September 2003 was $522,000. There were no movements in the investments held during the year.<br /> (iii) On 1 November 2003, Hi was informed that one of its customers, X, had ceased trading. The liquidators advised Hi that it was very unlikely to receive payment of any of the $45,000 due from X at 30 September 2003.<br /> (iv) Another customer is suing for damages as a consequence of a faulty product. Legal advisers are currently advising that the probability of Hi being found liable is 75%. The amount payable is estimated to be the full amount claimed of $100,000.<br /> (v) The income tax due for the year ended 30 September 2003 is estimated at $1,180,000 and the deferred tax provision needs to be increased to $281,000.<br /> (vi) During the year, Hi disposed of old equipment for $11,000. The original cost of this equipment was $210,000 and accumulated depreciation at 30 September 2002 was $205,000. Hi’s accounting policy is to charge no depreciation in the year of the disposal.<br /> (vii) Depreciation is charged using the straight-line basis on non-current assets as follows:<br /> Buildings 3%<br /> Equipment and fixtures 20%<br /> Depreciation is regarded as a cost of sales.<br /> (viii) On 1 April 2003, Hi made a rights issue of 1 new share for 4 existing shares, at a price of $3. The fair value of one share prior to the rights issue was $4.25 per share. All the rights were taken up and all money paid by 30 September 2003.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Prepare the income statement for Hi for the year to 30 September 2003 and a balance sheet at that date, in a form suitable for presentation to the shareholders, in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standards.<br /> Notes to the financial statements are NOT required, but all workings must be clearly shown. DO NOT prepare a statement of accounting policies or a statement of recognised gains and losses.<br /> (b) Prepare a statement of changes in equity for Hi for the year ended 30 September 2003.</p>
