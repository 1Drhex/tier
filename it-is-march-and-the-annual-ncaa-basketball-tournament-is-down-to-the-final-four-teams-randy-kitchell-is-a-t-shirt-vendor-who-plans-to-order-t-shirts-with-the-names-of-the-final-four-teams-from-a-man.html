            <p class="blog">It is March, and the annual NCAA Basketball Tournament is down to the final four teams. Randy Kitchell is a T-shirt vendor who plans to order T-shirts with the names of the final four teams from a manufacturer and then sell them to the fans. The fixed cost of any order is $750, the variable cost per T-shirt to Randy is $8, and Randy’s selling price is $18. However, this price will be charged only until a week after the tournament. After that time, Randy figures that interest in the T-shirts will be low, so he plans to sell all remaining T‑shirts, if any, at $6 each. His best guess is that demand for the T-shirts during the full-price period will be 1500. He is thinking about ordering 1450 T-shirts, but he wants to build a spreadsheet model that will let him experiment with the uncertain demand and his order quantity. How should he proceed?</p> <p class="blog">Objective<br /> To build a spreadsheet model in a series of stages, with all stages being correct but each stage being more readable and flexible than the previous stages.</p>

The logic behind the model is fairly simple, but the model is built for generality. Specifically, the formulas allow for the order quantity to be less than, equal to, or greater than demand. If demand is greater than the order quantity, Randy will sell all the T-shirts ordered for $18 each. If demand is less than the order quantity, Randy will sell as many T-shirts as are demanded at the $18 price and all leftovers at the $6 price. You can implement this logic in Excel with an IF function.<br /> A first attempt at a spreadsheet model appears in Figure 1.2. (See the file TShirt Sales Finished.xlsx, where each stage appears on a separate worksheet.) You enter a possible demand in cell B3, a possible order quantity in cell B4, and then calculate the profit in cell B5 with the formula<br /> <strong>=−750−8*B4+IF(B3&gt;B4,18*B4,18*B3+6*(B4−B3))</strong><br /> This formula subtracts the fixed and variable costs and then adds the revenue according to the logic just described.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This model in Figure 1.2 is entirely correct, but it isn’t very readable or flexible because it breaks a rule that you should never break: It hard codes input values into the profit formula. A spreadsheet model should never include input numbers in formulas. Instead, it should store input values in separate cells and then use cell references to these inputs in its formulas. A remedy appears in Figure 1.3, where the inputs have been entered in the range B3:B6, and the profit formula in cell B10 has been changed to<br /> <strong>=−B3−B4*B91+F(B8&gt;B9,B5*B9,B5*B8+B6*(B9−B8))</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
This is exactly the same formula as before, but it is now more flexible. If an input changes, the profit recalculates automatically. Most important, the inputs are no longer buried in the formula.<br /> Still, the profit formula is not very readable as it stands. You can make it more readable by using range names. The mechanics of range names are covered in detail later in this section. For now, the results of using range names for cells B3 through B6, B8, and B9 are shown in Figure 1.4. This model looks exactly like the previous model, but the formula in cell B10 is now<br /> <strong>=−Fixed_order_cost−Variable_cost*Order+IF(Demand&gt;Order, Selling_price*Order,Selling_price*Demand</strong><br /> <strong>+Discount_Price*(Order−Demand))</strong><br /> This formula is admittedly more long-winded, but it is easier to read.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, Randy might like to have profit broken down into various costs and revenues as shown in Figure 1.5, rather than one single profit cell. The formulas in cells B12, B13, B15, and B16 are straightforward, so they are not repeated here. You can then accumulate these to get profit in cell B17 with the formula<br /> <strong>=−(B12+B13)1(B15+B16)</strong><br /> Of course, range names could be used for these intermediate output cells, but this is probably more work than it’s worth. You should always use discretion when deciding how many range names to use.<br /> If you see the model in Figure 1.5, how do you know which cells contain inputs or decision variables or outputs? Labels and/or color coding can help to distinguish these types. A blue/red/gray color-coding style has been applied in Figure 1.6, along with descriptive labels in boldface. The blue cells at the top are input cells, the red cell in the middle is a decision variable,and the gray cell at the bottom is the key output. There is nothing sacred about this particular convention. Feel free to adopt your own convention and style, but use it consistently.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The model in Figure 1.6 is still not the last word on this example. As shown in later examples, you can create data tables to see how sensitive profit is to the inputs, the demand, and the order quantity. You can also create charts to show results graphically. But this is enough for now. You can see that the model in Figure 1.6 is now much more readable and flexible than the<br /> original model in Figure 1.2.</p>
