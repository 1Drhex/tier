The number of full-time employees required each day is given in Table 4.2. Company policy states that each full-time employee must work five consecutive days and then receive two days off. For example, an employee who works Monday to Friday must be off Saturday and Sunday. The company wants to meet its daily requirements using only fulltime employees. Its objective is to minimize the number of full-time employees on its payroll.</p> <p class="blog">Table 4.2 Employee Requirements</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 395px; height: 281px;" border="0" width="144" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Minimum Number of Employees Required</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Day of Week</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">17</td> <td dir="LTR">Monday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">13</td> <td dir="LTR">Tuesday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">15</td> <td dir="LTR">Wednesday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">19</td> <td dir="LTR">Thursday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">14</td> <td dir="LTR">Friday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">16</td> <td dir="LTR">Saturday</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">11</td> <td dir="LTR">sunday</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

A diagram of this model appears in Figure 4.13. (See the file Employee Scheduling Big Picture.xlsx.) The trickiest part is identifying the appropriate decision variables. You might think the decision variables are the numbers of employees working on the various days of the week. Clearly, these values must eventually be determined. However, it is not enough to specify, say, that 18 employees are working on Monday. The problem is that this doesn’t indicate when these 18 employees start their five-day shifts. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to implement the five-consecutive-day, two-day-off requirement. (If you don’t believe this, try developing your own model with the wrong decision variables. You will eventually reach a dead end.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The trick is to define the decision variables as the numbers of employees working each of the seven possible five-day shifts. By knowing the values of these decision variables, the other output variables can be calculated. For example, the number working on Thursday is the sum of those who begin their five-day shifts on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
<strong>Fundamental Insight</strong><br /> Choosing the Decision Variables<br /> The decision variables should always be chosen so that their values determine all required outputs in the model. In other words, their values should tell the company exactly how to run its business. Sometimes the choice of decision variables is obvious, but in many cases (as in this employee scheduling<br /> model), the proper choice of decision variables takes some deeper thinking about the problem. An improper choice of decision variables typically leads to a dead end, where their values do not supply enough information to calculate required outputs or implement certain constraints.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
Note that this is a “wraparound” problem. We assume that the daily requirements in Table 4.2 and the worker schedules continue week after week. So, for example, if eight employees are assigned to the Thursday through Monday shift, these employees always wrap around from one week to the next on their five-day shift.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The spreadsheet model for this example is shown in Figure 4.14. (See the file Employee Scheduling Finished.xlsx.) To form this spreadsheet, proceed as follows<br /> 1) Inputs and range names. Enter the number of employees needed on each day of the week (from Table 4.2) in the light blue cells, and create the range names shown.<br /> 2) Employees beginning each day. Enter any trial values for the number of employees beginning work on each day of the week in the Employees_starting range. These beginning days determine the possible five-day shifts. For example, the employees in cell B4 work Monday through Friday.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Employees on hand each day. The key to this solution is to realize that the numbers in the Employees_starting range—the decision variable cells—do not represent the number of employees who will show up each day. As an example, the number in cell B4 represent those who start on Monday and work Monday through Friday. Therefore, enter the formula<br /> =$B$4<br /> in cell B14 and copy it across to cell F14. Proceed similarly for rows 15–20, being careful to take wraparounds into account. For example, the employees starting on Thursday work Thursday through Sunday, plus Monday. Then calculate the total number who are available on each day by entering the formula<br /> =SUM(B14:B20)<br /> in cell B23 and copying it across to cell H23.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: CTRL+Enter Shortcut<br /> You often enter a typical formula in a cell and then copy it. One way to do this efficiently is to select the entire range, here B23:H23. Then enter the typical formula, here =SUM(B14:B20), and press Ctrl1Enter. This has the same effect as copying, but it is slightly quicker.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Total employees. Calculate the total number of employees in cell B28 with the formula<br /> =SUM(Employees_starting)<br /> Note that there is no double-counting in this sum. For example, the employees in cells B4 and B5 are not the same people. At this point, you might want to experiment with the numbers in the decision variable cells to see whether you can guess an optimal solution (without looking at Figure 4.14). It is not that easy. Each employee who starts on a given day works the next four days as well, so when you find a solution that meets the minimal requirements for the various days, you usually have a few more employees available on some days than are needed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> Invoke Solver and fill out its main dialog box as shown in Figure 4.15. (You don’t need to include the integer constraints yet. We will discuss them shortly.) Make sure you check the Non-Negative option and use the Simplex LP method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution shown in Figure 4.14 has one drawback: It requires the number of employees starting work on some days to be a fraction. Because part-time employees are not allowed, this solution is unrealistic. However, it is simple to add an integer constraint on the decision variable cells. This integer constraint appears in Figure 4.15. With this integer constraint, the optimal solution appears in Figure 4.16.<br /> The decision variable cells in the optimal solution indicate the numbers of employees who start their five-day shifts on the various days. You can then look at the columns of the B14:H20 range to see which employees are working on any given day. This optimal solution is typical in scheduling problems. Due to a company policy—each employee must work five consecutive days and then have two days off—it is typically impossible to meet the minimum employee requirements exactly. To ensure that there are enough employees available on busy days, it is necessary to have more than enough on hand on light days.<br /> Another interesting aspect of this problem is that if you solve this problem on your own computer, you might get a different schedule that is still optimal—that is, a solution that still uses a total of 23 employees and meets all constraints. This is a case of multiple optimal solutions,<br /> not at all uncommon in LP problems. In fact, it is typically good news for a manager, who can then choose among the optimal solutions using other, possibly nonquantitative criteria<span class="tex-text">\(.^{3}\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Technical Tip</strong>: Solver Integer Optimality Setting<br /> When working with integer constraints, you should be aware of Solver’s Integer Optimality setting. (In pre-2007 versions of Excel, this was called the Tolerance setting.) The idea is as follows. As Solver searches for the best integer solution, it is often able to find a “good” solution fairly quickly, but it often has to spend a lot of time finding slightly better solutions. A nonzero setting allows it to quit early. The default setting is 1, meaning 1 percent. (It was 5 in previous versions of Excel.). This implies that if Solver finds a feasible solution that is guaranteed to have an objective value no more than 1% from the optimal value, it will quit and report this good solution (which might even be the optimal solution). Therefore, if you keep this default value, your integer solutions will sometimes not be optimal, but they will be close. If you want to ensure that you get an optimal solution, you can change the Solver integer optimality value to zero. (In Excel 2010 and later versions, this setting is directly under the Solver Options on the All Methods tab.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> The most obvious type of sensitivity analysis in this example is to analyze the effect of employee requirements on the optimal solution. Specifically, let’s suppose the number of employees needed on each day of the week increases by two, four, or six. How does this change the total number of employees needed? You can answer this with SolverTable, but you must first modify the model slightly, as shown in Figure 4.17. The problem is that we want to increase each of the daily minimal required values by the same amount. The trick is to enter the original requirements in row 12, enter a trial value for the extra number required per day in cell K12, enter the formula =B12+$K$12 in cell B27, and then copy this formula across to cell H27. Now you can use the one- way SolverTable option, using cell K12 as the single input, letting it vary from 0 to 6 in increments of 2, and specifying the Total_employees cell as the single output cell.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results appear in Figure 4.18. When the requirement increases by two each day, only two extra employees are necessary (scheduled appropriately). However, when the requirement increases by four each day, more than four extra employees are necessary. The same is true when the requirement increases by six each day. This might surprise you at first, but there is an intuitive reason: Each extra employee works only five days of the week.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that we did not use Solver’s sensitivity report here for two reasons. First, Solver does not offer a sensitivity report for models with integer constraints. Second, even if the integer constraints are deleted, Solver’s sensitivity report does not answer questions about multiple input changes, as we have asked here. It can be used only for questions about oneat-a-time changes to inputs, such as a change to a specific day’s worker requirement. In this sense, SolverTable is a more flexible tool.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Modeling Issues</strong><br /> 1. The employee scheduling example is called a static scheduling model because we assume that the company faces the same situation each week. In reality, demands change over time, employees take vacations in the summer, and so on, so the company does not face the same situation each week. A dynamic scheduling model (not discussed here) is necessary for such problems.<br /> 2. In a weekly scheduling model for a supermarket or a fast- food restaurant, the number of decision variables can grow quickly and optimization software such as Solver will have difficulty finding an optimal solution. In such cases, heuristic methods (essentially clever trial-and-error algorithms) have been used to find good solutions to the problem.<br /> 3. Our model can easily be expanded to handle part-time employees, the use of overtime, and alternative objectives such as maximizing the number of weekend days off received by employees. You are asked to explore such extensions in the problems.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
3:It is usually difficult to tell whether there are multiple optimal solutions. You typically discover this by rerunning Solver from different starting solutions.</p>
