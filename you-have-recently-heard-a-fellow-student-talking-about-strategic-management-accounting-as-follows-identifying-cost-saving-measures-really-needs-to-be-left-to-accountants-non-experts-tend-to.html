<strong>Student’s statements</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
The student is substantially wrong here. Non-experts, in the sense of not being accountants, may well be experts about certain costs because they are involved with costs being incurred as they carry out their work. Many well-managed businesses encourage staff members of all types to look out for and recommend cost saving measures that could be introduced. Making staff cost conscious through training, perhaps including some basic costing principles like the difference between fixed and variable costs, could be helpful. This a long way from saying that only accountants can spot cost saving measures. Customer profitability analysis is concerned with assessing how profitable particular customers are to one’s own business, as customers. This involves preparing a ‘mini income statement’ for each customer or, perhaps, group of customers. Here all of the costs of providing the business’s goods or services to the customer are taken into account. This includes not just the cost of providing the basic goods or service, but also other costs that probably vary between customers, such as delivery costs, warehousing (stores) costs and the costs of providing trade credit. How profitable the customer is as a business is not the subject of customer profitability analysis, though this would be of interest to the supplying business. The student is therefore wrong in stating this. SVA is an approach to management that focuses on the generally accepted business objective of maximisation of shareholder wealth. It does this by identifying a number of ‘value drivers’ that are seen as key to delivering value for shareholders. Plans can be made in respect of each of these key value drivers. These plans can be used as the basis of day-today management targets, against which managers can be assessed. SVA has little to do with the preferences of individual shareholders for dividends rather than retained profits.</p>
 <p class="blog">
EVA<sup>®</sup> stands for ‘economic value added’, not ‘equity value analysis’. It tries to measure the extent to which a period of trading has led to value being created for shareholders. It tries to assess whether the profit generated by the business exceeds the minimum required to maintain the shareholders’ wealth. The latter is based on the shareholders’ required return and a fair assessment of the value of the assets in use in generating that profit. Though SVA and EVA<sup>®</sup> are quite closely linked, in that they both focus on achieving shareholder wealth maximisation, they approach this in rather different ways and are certainly not the same thing. The Balanced Scorecard is certainly not another name for the balance sheet. It is an attempt to provide financial and non-financial targets for managing the business. It seeks to strike a balance between financial and non-financial, external and internal, and predictive and historic factors. The balance sheet deals only with financial matters and has no connection with the Balanced Scorecard, except that both use the word ‘balance’ in their names.</p>
