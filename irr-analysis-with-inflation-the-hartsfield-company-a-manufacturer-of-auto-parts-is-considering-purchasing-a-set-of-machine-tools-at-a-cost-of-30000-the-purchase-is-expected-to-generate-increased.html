 <p class="blog">
(a) <strong>Rate-of-return analysis without inflation:</strong> We find the rate of return by first computing the after-tax cash flow using the income statement approach, as illustrated in Table 11.11. The first part of the table shows the calculation of additional sales, operating costs, depreciation, and taxes. The asset will be depreciated fully over four years with no expected salvage value. As we emphasized in Chapter 10, depreciation is not a cash expense, although it affects taxable income, and thus, cash flow, indirectly. Therefore, we must add depreciation to net income to determine the net cash flow.Thus, if the investment is made, we expect to receive additional annual cash flows of $12,700, $14,033, $10,478, and $9,589. This is a simple investment, so we can calculate the <span class="tex-text">\(IRR^{&#039;}\)</span> for the project as</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(PW\left(i^{&#039;} \right) = -\$30,000 + \$12,700 \left(P/F,i^{&#039;},1\right) + \$14,033\left(P/F,i^{&#039;},2\right)\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(+ \$10,478\left(P/F,i^{&#039;},3\right) + \$9,589\left(P/F,i^{&#039;},4\right)\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= 0</p>
 <p class="blog">
Solving for <span class="tex-text">\(i^{&#039;}\)</span> yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(IRR^{&#039;} = i^{&#039;*} = 21.88\%\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The project has an inflation-free rate of return of 21.88%; that is, the company will recover its original investment ($30,000) plus interest at 21.88% each year or each dollar still invested in the project. Since <span class="tex-text">\(IRR^{&#039;}\gt MARR^{&#039;}\)</span> (20%), the company should buy the equipment.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) <strong>Rate-of-return analysis under inflation:</strong> With inflation, we assume that sales, operating costs, and the future selling price of the asset will increase. Depreciation will be unchanged, but taxes, profits, and cash flow will be higher. We might think that higher cash flows will mean an increased rate of return. Unfortunately, this is not the case. We must recognize that cash flows for each year are stated in dollars of declining purchasing power. When the net after-tax cash flows are converted to dollars with the same purchasing power as those used to make the original investment, the resulting rate of return decreases. These calculations (assuming an inflation rate of 10% in sales and operating expenses meaning a 10% annual decline in the purchasing power of the dollar) are shown in Table 11.12. For example, whereas additional sales had been $24,500 yearly, under conditions of inflation, they would be 10% greater in year 1 (or $26,950), 21% greater in year 2, and so forth. No change in investment or depreciation expenses will occur, since these items are unaffected by expected future inflation. We have restated the after-tax cash flows (actual dollars) in dollars of a common purchasing power (constant dollars) by deflating them—again assuming an annual deflation factor of 10%. The constant-dollar cash flows then are used to determine the real rate of return. First,</p>

 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(+ \$10,036\left(P/F,i^{&#039;},3\right) + \$9,307\left(P/F,i^{&#039;},4\right)\)</span></p>

Solving for <span class="tex-text">\(i^{&#039;}\)</span> yields</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i^{&#039;*} = 19.40\%\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The rate of return for the project’s cash flows in constant dollars (year-0 dollars) is 19.40%, which is less than the 21.88% return in the inflation-free case. Since <span class="tex-text">\(IRR^{&#039;}\lt MARR^{&#039;}\)</span> , the investment is no longer acceptable.</p>
