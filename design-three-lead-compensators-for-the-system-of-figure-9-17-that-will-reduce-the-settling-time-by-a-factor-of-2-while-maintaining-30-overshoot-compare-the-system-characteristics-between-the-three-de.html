First determine the characteristics of the uncompensated system operating at 30% overshoot to see what the uncompensated settling time is. Since 30% overshoot is equivalent to a damping ratio of 0.358, we search along the <span class="tex-text">\(\zeta = 0.358\)</span> line for the uncompensated dominant poles on the root locus, as shown in Figure 9.26. From the poleâ€™s real part, we calculate the uncompensated settling time as <span class="tex-text">\(T_{s} = &#8211; 4/1.007 = 3.972\)</span> seconds. The remaining characteristics of the uncompensated system are summarized in Table 9.4.</p>

Next we find the design point. A twofold reduction in settling time yields <span class="tex-text">\(T_{s} = 3.972/2 = 1.986\)</span> seconds, from which the real part of the desired pole location is <span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; \zeta \omega _{n} =4/T_{s} = &#8211; 2.014\)</span>. The imaginary part is <span class="tex-text">\(\omega _{d} = &#8211; 2.014 tan(110.98^{\circ}) = 5.252\)</span>. We continue by designing the lead compensator. Arbitrarily assume a compensator zero at &#8211; 5 on the real axis as a possible solution. Using the root locus program, sum the angles from both this zero and the uncompensated systemâ€™s poles and zeros, using the design point as a test point. The resulting angle is <span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; 172.69^{\circ}\)</span>. The difference between this angle and <span class="tex-text">\(180^{\circ}\)</span> is the angular contribution required from the compensator pole in order to place the design point on the root locus. Hence, an angular contribution of <span class="tex-text">\(&#8211; 7.31 ^{\circ}\)</span> is required from the compensator pole.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The geometry shown in Figure 9.27 is used to calculate the location of the compensator pole. From the figure,</p>

from which the compensator pole is found to be</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(p_{c} = 42.96\)</span> (9:20)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The compensated system root locus is sketched in Figure 9.28.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In order to justify our estimates of percent overshoot and settling time, we must show that the second-order approximation is valid. To perform this validity check, we search for the third and fourth closed-loop poles found beyond &#8211; 42.96 and between &#8211; 5 and &#8211; 6 in Figure 9.28. Searching these regions for the gain equal to that of the compensated dominant pole, 1423, we find that the third and fourth poles are at &#8211; 43.8 and &#8211; 5.134, respectively. Since &#8211; 43.8 is more than 20 times the real part of the dominant pole, the effect of the third closed-loop pole is negligible. Since the closed-loop pole at &#8211; 5.134 is close to the zero at &#8211; 5, we have pole-zero cancellation, and the second-order approximation is valid.</p>
 <p class="blog">
All results for this design and two other designs, which place the compensator zero arbitrarily at &#8211; 2 and &#8211; 4 and follow similar design techniques, are summarized in Table 9.4. Each design should be verified by a simulation, which could consist of using MATLAB (discussed at the end of this example) or the state-space model and the step-response program. We have performed a simulation for this design problem, and the results are shown by parenthetical entries next to the estimated values in the table. The only design that disagrees with the simulation is the case where the compensator zero is at &#8211; 2. For this case the closed-loop pole and zero do not cancel.</p>
 <p class="blog">
A sketch of the root locus, which you should generate, shows why the effect of the zero is pronounced, causing the response to be different from that predicted. Placing the zero to the right of the pole at &#8211; 4 creates a portion of the root locus that is between the origin and the zero. In other words, there is a closed-loop pole closer to the origin than the dominant poles, with little chance of pole-zero cancellation except at high gain. Thus, a quick sketch of the root locus gives us information from which we can make better design decisions. For this example, we want to place the zero on, or to the left of, the pole at &#8211; 4, which gives a better chance for pole-zero cancellation and for a higher-order pole that is to the left of the dominant poles and subsequently faster. This is verified by the fact that our results show good second- order approximations for the cases where the zero was placed at &#8211; 4 and &#8211; 5. Again, decisions about where to place the zero are based on simple rules of thumb and must be verified by simulations at the end of the design.<br /> Let us now summarize the results shown in Table 9.4. First we notice differences in the following:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. The position of the arbitrarily selected zero</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. The amount of improvement in the steady-state error</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. The amount of required gain, K</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. The position of the third and fourth poles and their relative effect upon the second-order approximation. This effect is measured by their distance from the dominant poles or the degree of cancellation with the closed-loop zero.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once a simulation verifies desired performance, the choice of compensation can be based upon the amount of gain required or the improvement in steady-state error that can be obtained without a lag compensator.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results of Table 9.4 are supported by simulations of the step response, shown in Figure 9.29 for the uncompensated system and the three lead compensation solutions.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We can use MATLAB to design a lead compensator. The program allows us to input a desired percent overshoot via the keyboard.<br /> MATLAB then produces a root locus for the uncompensated system with an overlay of the percent overshoot line. We interactively select the intersection of the root locus and the desired percent overshoot line to set the gain. MATLAB outputs an estimate of the uncompensated systemâ€™s performance specifications and a step response of the uncompensated system for us to determine the required settling time. Next we input the settling time and the lead compensator zero through the keyboard. At this point we take a different approach from that of the previous example. Rather than letting MATLAB calculate the lead compensator pole directly, MATLAB produces a root locus for every interactive guess of a lead compensator pole. Each root locus contains the desired damping ratio and natural frequency curves. When our guess is correct, the root locus, the damping ratio line, and the natural frequency curve will intersect. We then interactively select this point of intersection to input the gain. Finally, MATLAB produces an estimate of the lead-compensated systemâ€™s performance specifications and a step response of the lead-compensated system.</p>
