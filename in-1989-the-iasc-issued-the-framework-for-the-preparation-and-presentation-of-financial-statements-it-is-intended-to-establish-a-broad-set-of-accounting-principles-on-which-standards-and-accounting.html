The Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements provides guidance on the broad principles that the IASB has agreed should form the basis of accounting rules and standards. It gives guidance on how items should be recognised, measured and presented.</p>
 <p class="blog">
developed are done so within this Framework. This ensures that the accounting rules and treatment of items being developed are consistent. The Framework acts as a point of reference for the standard-setters; when dealing with a technical point they can consider the Framework and ensure that the outcome is consistent with the principles it contains.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Framework has also helped where there is no specific standard covering a technical issue. Preparers of financial information can refer to the Framework and see how similar items have been treated. The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee often provide Draft Interpretations as an interim solution in the absence of a specific standard. The IFRIC ensures that the interpretations are consistent with the principles within the Framework and therefore are consistent with the generally accepted rules of the IASB, until the issue can be dealt with fully in a standard.</p>
 <p class="blog">
International Accounting Standards are, generally, less prescriptive, and so the Framework acts as a point of reference for preparers and users of accounts prepared in accordance with them.<br /> The Framework removes the need for IASB to address underlying issues over and over again. For example, the Framework gives definitions of assets and liabilities. These definitions must be met for items to be included in financial statements. This is an underlying principle, and as the accounting standards are based on the principles within the Framework they need not be dealt with fully in each of the standards.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The increasing complexity of the business environment has resulted in a great number of specific accounting standards being developed. The IASB has to date issued more than 40 IFRSs and IASs. It is vital that each standard is developed within the broad Framework of principles. The existence of the Framework assists the IASB in the development of specific accounting standards, by ensuring that they follow a consistent approach to recognition<br /> and measurement.<br /> Many of the IFRSs provide a choice of allowable treatments for items. The IASB designates one the ‘benchmark’ treatment and the other(s) as an allowable alternative treatment. The development of the Framework is now expected to result in these alternatives gradually being removed, and the preferred treatment will be that which is consistent with the Framework.</p>
