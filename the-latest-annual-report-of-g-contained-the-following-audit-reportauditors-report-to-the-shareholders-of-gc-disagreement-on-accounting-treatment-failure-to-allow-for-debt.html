            <p class="blog">The latest annual report of G contained the following audit report:<br /> Auditor’s report to the shareholders of GC<br /> Disagreement on accounting treatment – failure to allow for debt – qualified opinion We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of GC as of 31 December, 20X1, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.<br /> We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Included in the receivables shown on the balance sheet is an amount of $960,000 due from an entity which has ceased trading. GC has no security for this debt. In our opinion, GC is unlikely to receive any payment and full allowance of $960,000 should have been made, reducing profit before tax and net assets by that amount.<br /> In our opinion, except for the absence of this allowance, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the entity as of 31 December 20X1, and of the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Accounting Standards and relevant statutes.<br /> AUDITOR<br /> Date<br /> Address<br /> At the annual general meeting following the publication of this annual report, GC’s management explained that this audit report was ‘qualified’ because of a disagreement between the management and the auditor.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Explain why this report should be described as qualified and explain the meaning of this qualification to the readers of the financial statements.<br /> (b) Describe the circumstances in which the auditor would be forced to qualify the report on the financial statements using the form of qualification as applied above.</p>

(a) The report contains a subheading to the effect that it has been qualified. That highlights the more substantive fact that the report goes on to describe a problem with the accounting treatment of a possible bad debt. The auditor is of the opinion that a provision that should have been made has not been accounted for. The final indicator is that the auditor’s opinion states that the accounts give a true and fair view, but that is only ‘except for’ the absence of a provision. That means that the auditor does not have an unreserved opinion that the statements give a fair presentation.<br /> The qualification suggests that the directors have overstated the profit for the year by $960,000. It also suggests that the current assets have been overstated by the same amount. This would suggest that any ROCE ratios, liquidity ratios and, possibly, receivables turnover ratios could be misleading. It is, however, up to the shareholders to decide for themselves whether they agree with the auditor’s opinion on the treatment of the potential bad debt. They may feel that the auditor is an impartial commentator and would not have raised the matter without good reason. Alternatively, they might be of the opinion that the auditor has been overcautious and that the income statement and balance sheet prepared by management are fine as they stand.<br /> (b) Auditors use this form of qualification if they are of the opinion that the financial statements contain a material misstatement. In other words if they disagree with the facts, figures or disclosures prepared by the directors and if the extent of this disagreement is sufficient to affect the behaviour of the users of the financial statements.<br /> Deciding to use this form of qualification is a serious matter. By reporting in this way, the auditor could undermine the shareholders’ confidence in the figures prepared by the directors. They could even undermine confidence in the reliability of the directors themselves.<br /> If the auditor disagrees with the directors, the first question to decide is whether that disagreement is material. If the amounts involved are insignificant then there is very little point in raising them in the audit report.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then the auditor must decide whether the disagreement is a legitimate difference of opinion or whether there is a matter of fact or principle which is definitely unacceptable. For example, if the directors have chosen one of two acceptable treatments for a particular balance, their treatment is consistent over time and the policy is clearly stated, then it would not really matter that the auditor preferred the alternative treatment. Finally, the auditor should attempt to persuade the directors to change their statements. It would be better for all concerned if the auditor could justify an opinion that the accounts give a fair presentation. It is possible that the directors will be willing to change their proposed treatment to accommodate the auditor.</p>
