You can use StatTools to implement the simple exponential smoothing model, specifically equations (12.12) and (12.13). You do this again by selecting Forecast from the StatTools Time Series and Forecasting dropdown list. Specifically, you fill in the forecast dialog box essentially as with moving averages, except that you select the simple exponential smoothing option in the Forecast Settings tab (see Figure 12.31). You should also choose a smoothing constant (0.2 was chosen here, but any other value could be chosen) or you can elect to find an optimal smoothing constant.</p>

The results appear in Figures 12.32, 12.33 (with many hidden rows), and 12.34. The heart of the method takes place in columns C, D, and E of Figure 12.33. Column C calculates the smoothed levels <span class="tex-text">\(\left(L_{t}\right)\)</span> from Equation (12.12), column D calculates the forecasts <span class="tex-text">\(\left(F_{t}\right)\)</span> from Equation (12.13), and column E calculates the forecast errors <span class="tex-text">\(\left(E_{t}\right)\)</span> as the observed values minus the forecasts. Although the Excel formulas do not appear in the figure, you can examine them in the StatTools output.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Every exponential smoothing method requires initial values, in this case the initial smoothed level in cell C35. There is no way to calculate this value, <span class="tex-text">\(L_{1}\)</span>, from Equation (12.12) because the previous value, <span class="tex-text">\(L_{0}\)</span>, is unknown. Different implementations of exponential smoothing initialize in different ways. StatTools initializes by setting <span class="tex-text">\(L_{1} \text { equal to } Y_{1}\)</span> (in cell B35). The effect of initializing in different ways is usually minimal because any effect of early data is usually washed out as forecasts are made into the future.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the 12 future forecasts (rows 133 down) are all equal to the last calculated smoothed level, the one for February 2018 in cell C132. The fact that these remain constant is a consequence of the assumption behind simple exponential smoothing, namely, that the series is not really going anywhere. Therefore, the last smoothed level is the best available indication of future values of the series.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 12.34 shows the forecast series superimposed on the original series. You can see the obvious smoothing effect of a relatively small α level. If the various zigzags in the original series are really random noise, then perhaps the forecasts shouldn’t try to track these random ups and downs too closely. That is, perhaps a forecast series that emphasizes the basic underlying pattern is preferred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In the next subsection, Holt’s method is used on this series to see whether it captures the trend better than simple exponential smoothing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can see several summary measures of the forecast errors in Figure 12.32. The MAE and RMSE indicate that the forecasts from this model are typically off by a magnitude of about 29 to 36 thousand, and the MAPE indicates that they are off by about 6.6%. These are fairly sizable errors. One way to reduce the errors is to use a different smoothing method. We will try this in the next subsection with Holt’s method. Another way to reduce the errors is to use a different smoothing constant. There are two methods you can use. First, you can simply enter different values in the smoothing constant cell in the Forecast sheet. All formulas, including those for MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, will update automatically.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Second, you can check the Optimize Parameters option in the Forecast dialog box shown in Figure 12.31. This automatically runs an optimization algorithm to find the smoothing constant that minimizes RMSE. (StatTools is programmed to minimize RMSE. However, you could try minimizing MAPE, say, by using Excel’s Solver add-in.) When this optimization option is used for the housing data, the results (not shown here but available in the finished version of the file) indicate an optimal smoothing constant of 0.542 and slightly lower values of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE than before. This larger smoothing constant produces a less smooth forecast curve and slightly better error measures. However, there is no guarantee that future forecasts made with this optimal smoothing constant will be any better than with a smoothing constant of 0.2.</p>
