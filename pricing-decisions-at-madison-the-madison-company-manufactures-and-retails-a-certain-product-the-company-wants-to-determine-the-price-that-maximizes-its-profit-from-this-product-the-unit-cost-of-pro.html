The variables and constraints for this model appear in Figure 7.9. (See the file Basic Pricing Big Picture.xlsx.) The price drives everything. Through a demand function, price determines demand, and these combine to determine the revenue, cost, and profit. (We assume the company produces only what it can sell—that is, it observes its demand and then produces exactly this much.) The only constraint is that the company doesn’t want to charge a price less than its unit cost. More specifically, if Madison charges P dollars per unit, then its profit is (P 2 50)D, where D is the demand. The problem, however, is that D depends on P. As the price P increases, the demand D decreases. Therefore, the first step is to estimate how D varies with P—that is, to estimate the demand function. In fact, this is the first step in almost all pricing problems. We illustrate two possibilities: a linear demand function of the form D = a &#8211; bP, and a constant elasticity demand function of the form D = a<span class="tex-text">\(P^{b}\)</span>.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Estimating the Demand Function</strong><br /> You might recall from microeconomics that the elasticity of demand is the percentage change in demand caused by a 1% increase in price. The larger the magnitude of elasticity,<br /> the more demand reacts to price changes. The advantage of the constant elasticity demand function is that the elasticity remains constant over all points on the demand curve. For example, the elasticity of demand is the same when the price is $60 as when the price is $70. Actually, the exponent b in the constant elasticity demand function is approximately equal to this constant elasticity. For example, if b = -2.5, demand decreases by about 2.5% when price increases by 1%. In contrast, the elasticity changes for different price levels when the demand function is linear. Nevertheless, both forms of demand functions are commonly used in economic models, and either could be used here.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Regardless of the form of the demand function, the parameters of the function (a and b) must be estimated before any price optimization can be performed. This can be done with Excel trend lines. (Trend lines were introduced in Chapter 2.) Suppose that Madison can estimate two points on the demand curve. (At least two are required. More than two can be used in the same way.) Specifically, suppose the company estimates demand to be 400 units when price equals $70 and 300 units when price equals $80. Then you can create a scatter chart of demand versus price from these two points, select any point on the chart, and use Excel’s Trendline tool with the option to list the equation of the trend line on the chart. For a linear demand curve, you should select the Linear Trendline option, and for the constant elasticity demand curve, you should select the Power Trendline option. (The relevant dialog box appears in Figure 7.10. To get to it, right-click any point on the chart and select Add Trendline.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The results are presented in Figure 7.11, where both the linear estimate and the constant elasticity estimate are shown. (When you do this, the constant for the constant elasticity curve appears as 4E+06. To get more significant digits, just select the equation and then use the Format menu and the Number tab to format the number appropriately.) Either of these trend line equations can be used as an estimate of the demand function for the pricing model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> Given a demand function, the pricing decision is straightforward, as shown in Figure 7.12. (See the file Basic Pricing Finished.xlsx.) Here we have used the constant elasticity demand curve. (The model for linear demand is similar. The file illustrates both cases.) The model requires the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. The inputs for this model are the unit cost and the parameters of the demand function. Enter them as shown.<br /> 2) Price. Enter any trial value for price. It is the single decision variable.<br /> 3) Demand. Calculate the corresponding demand from the demand function by entering the formula<br /> =B7*Price^C7<br /> in cell B11.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Profit. Calculate the profit as unit contribution (price minus unit cost) multiplied by demand with the formula<br /> =(Price-Unit_cost)*B11<br /> in cell B12.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The relevant Solver dialog box is shown in Figure 7.13. The objective is to maximize profit subject to the constraint that price must be at least as large as unit cost, with price as the only decision variable. However, you should choose the GRG Nonlinear method, not the Simplex LP method. This model is nonlinear for two reasons. First, the demand function is nonlinear in price because price is raised to a power. But even if the demand function were linear, profit would still be nonlinear because it involves the product of price and demand, and demand is a function of price. This nonlinearity can be seen easily with the data table and corresponding chart in Figure 7.12. These show how profit varies with price—the relationship is clearly nonlinear. Profit increases to a maximum, and then declines slowly. (This type of data table and chart are useful in nonlinear models with a single decision variable. They show exactly how the objective changes as the decision variable changes. We employ these data tables in other nonlinear examples whenever possible.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> Guessing the optimal price in this type of model is usually not easy. As the company increases its price, it makes more money on each unit sold, but it sells fewer units. Therefore, the trade-off is always between selling a few relatively high- riced units and selling a lot of relatively low-priced units. Complicating the matter is the fact that as price increases, total cost decreases (because fewer units are demanded). In the present case, you can see from the graph in Figure 7.12 that profit increases fairly quickly as price goes from $55 to about $85. After this point, profit is almost unaffected by price (at least for the range of prices shown), and any price from $85 to about $110 results in a profit within $300 of the optimal profit. Of course, Solver does better than this; it finds the optimal price, $93.31.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Is the Solver Solution Optimal?</strong><br /> In general, there is no guarantee that profit is a concave function for all possible inputs to this model. However, the graph in Figure 7.12 indicates that it is concave for the particular inputs we have used and that the Solver solution is indeed optimal (because there is no local maximum that isn’t a global maximum). In this case, the Multistart option was not used. However, if you want to use it, you should add an upper bound constraint on price—even a large one such as Price ≤ 200. (Remember that Multistart works best with bounds on the decision variables.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> From an economic point of view, it should be interesting to see how the profit-maximizing price varies with the elasticity of the demand function. To do this, use SolverTable with the elasticity in cell C7 as the single input cell, allowing it to vary from 22.4 to 21.8 in increments of 0.1<span class="tex-text">\(.^{3}\)</span> (Note that when the range of input values is negative, the one with the largest magnitude must be entered first in the SolverTable dialog box.) The results are shown in Figure 7.14. When the demand is most elastic (at the top of the table), increases in price have a greater effect on demand. Therefore, the company should not set the price as high in this case. Interestingly, when demand is least elastic, the company should not only charge a higher price, but this price results in a much higher profit. Would you have guessed this?</p>
