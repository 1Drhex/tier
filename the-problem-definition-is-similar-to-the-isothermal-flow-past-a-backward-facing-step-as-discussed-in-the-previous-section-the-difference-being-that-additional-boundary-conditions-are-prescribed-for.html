The difference being that additional boundary conditions are prescribed for the temperature field. The boundary conditions discussed by (Kondoh et al.1993) will be adopted. The solid bottom wall was assumed to be at a higher temperature than the fluid (results presented here are for air with <span class="tex-text">\(\operatorname{Pr}=0.71\)</span> entering the channel. All other solid walls were assumed to be insulated. Zero flux conditions were prescribed at the exit.

Three different meshes have been employed to make sure that the solutions presented were accurate. The first mesh used was the mesh shown in Figure 7.30. The second and third meshes are finer than the first mesh and are shown in Figure 7.42 . All three meshes were employed to study the heat transfer at a Reynolds number of 500 . The local Nusselt number distribution on the hot wall downstream of the step is shown in Figure 7.43. As seen, the Nusselt number difference between all three meshes was very small. Therefore, the second mesh was used in all the calculations in order to save computational time, as the difference between the local Nusselt number distribution of the finest mesh (third mesh) and the second was very small. The small oscillations in the local Nusselt number distribution, especially on the first mesh, was generated by the coarseness of the unstructured mesh.Figure 7.44 shows the temperature contours for all the different Reynolds numbers considered. Previous studies indicate that the maximum heat transfer occurred close to the reattachment point. The incompressible flow is attached to the wall from the inlet until it reaches the step. The flow is detached from the bottom wall and recirculation develops downstream of the step as shown previously for the nonisothermal case. The flow reattaches itself to the bottom wall after the recirculation in the downstream portion of the step. The location at which the reattachment takes place varies with the Reynolds number. The higher the Reynolds number, then the farther will be the reattachment point from the step. The reattachment distances from the step are given in Figure 7.44. These values are in close agreement with reported results (Kondoh et al. 1993 ) The thermal action predominantly takes place downstream of the step in the bottomportion of the channel. It may be observed that as the flow approaches the reattachment point, the thermal boundary layer shrinks indicating a stronger temperature gradient in the vicinity of the reattachment point and thus a higher heat transfer rate taking place close to this point. This is clearly demonstrated in Figure 7.45 where the local Nusselt number is plotted along the hot wall downstream of the step. The local Nusselt number starts with an almost zero value at the corner close to the step and increases smoothly to a maximum value close to the reattachment point and then drops. It appears that the peak Nusselt number value is calculated close to, but just after the reattachment point. After reaching the peak value, the local Nusselt number drops as the flow approaches the exit.</p>
