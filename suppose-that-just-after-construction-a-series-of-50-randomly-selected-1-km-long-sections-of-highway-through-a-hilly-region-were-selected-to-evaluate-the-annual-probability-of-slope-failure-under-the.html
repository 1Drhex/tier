If sections fail independently, and each year is also independent, then we have 50 independent observations of the “number of trials” (i.e., years) to first failure of a 1-km section. Under the given assumptions, the number of trials “to first failure” follows a geometric distribution. According to Section 1.9.3, the mean of the geometric distribution is</p>

Apparently the estimate of the annual probability of slope failure of 0.2 is in very close agreement with this data set.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The histogram is most easily formed by first sorting the observations from smallest to largest:</p>

&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 14, 21</p>

from which we see that we have nine 1-km sections which had slope failures in the first year, five in the second year, and so on. Dividing each of these frequencies by n = 50 gives us a normalized frequency of 0.18 for the first year, 0.1 for the second year, and so on. This leads to the normalized histogram in Figure 5.3.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 5.3 compares the histogram of the observed failure times, normalized to have unit area, with the fitted geometric distribution using <span class="tex-text">\(\hat{p}=0.199\)</span>. At least visually, the fit appears to be reasonable. The observed histogram is somewhat erratic, but this is to be expected from such a small data set. If we were able to repeat the set of observations at another similar length of highway, we would presumably see a similarly shaped histogram but having different details. It is possible that, on average, the two histograms would agree.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Since the estimated value of p agrees well with that hypothesized and since the histogram appears to be reasonably well fit by the geometric distribution, we conclude that the distribution hypothesis appears reasonable. One of the primary assumptions underlying the assumed distribution is that sections fail independently and whether this is true or not has not been tested in this solution; in order to do so, we would typically need both spatial location information as well as more data. From an intuitive point of view, it appears unlikely that sections will actually be completely independent. For one thing, ground tremors, if they occur, might encourage several sections to fail simultaneously—similarly with intense periods of rainfall in a region. However, a fully cross-correlated random field of slope failure times would be difficult to characterize using just these 50 observations (although an a priori model based on other information could be partially validated by these data). In general the assumption of independence is made by necessity and the resulting model must be viewed with caution. Actual failure probabilities would lie somewhere between those obtained using this independent model and a completely dependent model (which would be a single random variable).</p>
