            <p class="blog">Multiple Mutually Exclusive Alternatives<br /> Conspicuous Consumption Toys has a short-term (≈1 year) need for a part that will be included in this year’s fad toy. The part can be purchased, or it can be produced through either a capitalor a labor-intensive process.<br /> The expected volume is 8000 units, with a lower limit of 70% and an upper limit of 120%.<br /> The purchase price for 8000 units is estimated to be $50 per part 10%. For each 10% increase or decrease in the quantity, the expected price will change by 2.5%. The price falls if the quantity increases.</p> <p class="blog">The labor-intensive process will cost $40 per part for labor ( ±20%) and $50,000 in capital improvements, with no salvage value. The capital-intensive process will cost $400,000, with a lower limit of 95% and an upper limit of 115%. These capital expenditures also have no salvage value. The capital-intensive process also requires $5 per part in labor.<br /> Construct a spiderplot using cost per part as the y-axis.</p>

The base-case cost per part for each alternative is found as follows:<br /> LaborInt = 40 + 50,000/8000 = $46.25<br /> CapitalInt = 5 + 400,000/8000 = $55<br /> Purchased = $50<br /> The cost of the labor-intensive process has a range of ±$8 for labor productivity, based on ±20% of the $40 labor cost. The range for volume is -$1.04 to +$2.68 per part (50,000/9600 &#8211; 50,000/8000 to 50,000/5600 &#8211; 50,000/8000).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The capital-intensive process has limits of 95% to 115% of its $400K capital cost, or $380K to $460K. The cost per part is $52.5 to $62.5 = (5 + 380K/8K; 5 + 460K/8K). Since the capital cost is assumed to equal $400K as the volume changes, the cost per part ranges from $76.4 to $46.7 = (5 + 400K/5600; 5 + 400K/9600).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The purchased part has a cost uncertainty of ±10% or $45 to $55 at a volume of 8000. If the volume decreases by 30%, then the price increases by 7.5%, to $53.75. If the volume increases by 20%, then the price decreases by 5%, to $47.50.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The four sources of uncertainty produce six curves, as shown in Exhibit 17.19. The three curves for each cost as the volume changes are not independent. In all cases, the cost falls as volume increases, but it falls fastest for the capital-intensive process.<br /> The labor-intensive process seems to be superior for most assumptions within the limits described above. Even if the capital-intensive process were slightly cheaper, the labor-intensive process would likely be preferred on the basis of risk. If sales are high, the firm will do well, and it can probably afford a slightly higher cost per part. On the other hand, if sales are low, the firm will be doing poorly, and it will be additionally disadvantaged by the higher-than-anticipated costs of the capital-intensive option.</p>
