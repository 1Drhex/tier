            <p class="blog">Figure 16.5 shows a cascaded arrangement of three D flip-flops belonging to the TTL family of digital ICs. The circuit shown here is only a small part of a complex digital circuit. Each of the three flip-flops has a clock input-to-output propagation delay of 15 ns. The expected and observed outputs of the flip-flops for the first few clock cycles are listed in Table 16.2. Although the circuit shown here is that of a three-bit shift counter, the observed outputs are nowhere near to what they should have been in the case of a three-bit shift counter. Identify the possible cause for the observed outputs being different from the expected ones. All flip-flops are observed to be in the logic ‘0’ state just before application of the clock signal. The clock signals appearing at the input terminals of the three flip-flops, when seen individually, are observed to be clean and free of any noise content.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="504"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="7" width="504">Table 16.2 .</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2">Clock pulse</td> <td colspan="3">Expected output</td> <td colspan="3">Actual output</td> </tr> <tr> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_2\)</span></td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_1\)</span></td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_0\)</span></td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_2\)</span></td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_1\)</span></td> <td><span class="tex-text">\(Q_0\)</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/07/16.4-2-768x463.png"></div>

Initially, <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}=Q_{1}=Q_{0}=0\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(D_{2}\)</span>= l as <span class="tex-text">\(D_{2}\)</span> is fed from <span class="tex-text">\(\overline{Q_{0}} \)</span>. Therefore, with the occurrence of the first clock pulse, <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}\)</span> is expected to go to the logic ‘1’ state. Since <span class="tex-text">\(D_{1} = D_{0} = 0\)</span>,<span class="tex-text">\(Q_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{0}\)</span> are expected to remain in the logic ‘0’ state. However,<span class="tex-text">\(Q_{2}, Q_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(Q_{0}\)</span> are observed to make a transition to the logic ‘1’ state. Now this could have been possible if D2 = <span class="tex-text">\(D_{1}=D_{0}= 1\)</span>, which is not the case. This would be remotely possible if there were an external or an internal open at all the D inputs, making them floating inputs. Since the ICs used here are TTL ICs, these floating inputs would be treated as logic HIGH. All this seems to be valid for only the first clock pulse, because, if this were true, the three outputs would subsequently stay in the logic ‘1’ state. Here, all outputs are observed to be toggling. Whether there is any internal or external open or short can be verified with a continuity check using a multimeter.</p>
 <p class="blog">
There is another possibility.<span class="tex-text">\( A_{S}\)</span> we know, clock skew is a problem that quite often bothers flipflop timing. Whether or not the fault could possibly be due to the clock skew problem will now be examined. This is not an arbitrary choice. If the statement of the problem is carefully read, it is stated there that the given circuit is only a part of a bigger circuit, and also that clock signals have been observed only individually at the relevant inputs of different flip-flops. It is therefore quite possible that the clock signals at the clock inputs of different flip-flops are not synchronous. If the clock inputs to flip-flops FF-2 and FF-l are examined simultaneously and it is discovered that the clock input to FF-l is delayed from the clock input to FF-2 by more than 15 ns, FF-l will make a transition to the logic ‘1’ state with the first clock transition. Similarly, if the clock input to FF-0 is delayed by more than 15 ns from that to FF-l or by more than 30 ns from that to FF-2, even FF-0 is going to make a transition to the logic ‘1’ state with the first relevant transition of the clock signal. And what is more important is that all other observed outputs for subsequent clock pulses, as shown in Table 16.2, are also valid under these circumstances. The waveforms shown in Fig. 16.6 illustrate how this clock delay can cause a fault condition. Thus, this seems to be the most probable reason for the present fault condition.</p>
