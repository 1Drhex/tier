            <p class="blog">A business is experiencing cash problems and the advice of an accountant has been obtained. The accountant has identified the problem as being an excessive amount of trade recievables and it is clear that steps must be taken to reduce the time that is currently being taken by trade receivables. In addition, it seems that the level of bad debts is greater than for<br /> most other firms in the same line of business and this is reducing the firm’s profitability.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Design a system that will reduce the amount tied up in trade receivables and also reduce the amount of bad debts.<br /> (b) The managing director is keen to improve the situation but is worried that the proposed steps may affect the business adversely. Discuss the nature of the possible problems that might result from the proposals in your answer to (a).</p>

(a) Delays in the collection of the amounts owing by receivables can be seen as a loan to customers and will mean that the business ‘lending’ the money may become short of funds themselves. It is, therefore, imperative that a system be introduced that will identify the amounts that are overdue and ensure that steps are taken to collect the debts.<br /> At the same time as collecting the debts on time, an efficient debt collection process is likely to reduce the level of bad debts. A system will ensure that receivables are contacted as soon as the debt is overdue and this will put the collection procedure into action at the earliest opportunity.<br /> The firm’s credit policy must be designed to ensure that:<br /> ● the cash is received according to the firm’s credit policy;<br /> ● bad debts are avoided by ensuring that prompt attention is given to any accounts that are overdue;<br /> ● customers are aware of the credit terms and the collection procedures that will be used to collect outstanding debts.<br /> Initially, the management of the firm must agree on the credit terms that will be offered to customers and the conditions under which special credit arrangements will be granted. This policy should be made clear to the customers and the sales management so that misunderstandings are avoided.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Once an order is received, the customer must be screened to eliminate any potential problems before the goods or services are provided. This screening could include prior experience of the payment record of customers from either the firm or other businesses that collaborate on credit control. References from banks and specialised agencies will also be important in determining the creditworthiness of both new and existing customers.<br /> Once the invoice has been produced, records must be maintained of the dates on which payment is due. This should be monitored and ageing schedules produced regularly to ensure that steps are taken to remind customers that the payment is overdue. The offer of cash discounts is a matter that has to be addressed when the credit policy is formulated. It is important that the cost of offering cash discounts should be made clear as it can be an expensive way of speeding up the collection process.<br /> Another policy decision that needs to be addressed is whether factoring is to be used as a means of ensuring that the cash is received promptly. It is important that the costs and benefits of factoring are investigated.<br /> Finally, once the account is overdue, the debt collection process must be started to pursue the customer for payment. This is a procedure that must be cautiously but resolutely followed as errors can occur and this might alienate customers if they have already settled the account.<br /> A control mechanism must be instituted to monitor the time that receivables are taking and the extent to which bad debts are being incurred. These are important aspects of the credit control process and a balance between the prompt collection of outstanding debts and the effect on the existing and new customers must be assessed.<br /> (b) Although it is important that the cash must be collected within the agreed time, inflexible credit control can affect the business adversely. Initially, sales may be lost if credit is not offered. This means that the credit screening must be able to cope with many different situations in different industries.<br /> The follow-up of overdue accounts can cause problems with customers and it is important that both the administrative staff and the sales management are involved in the collection process. Every effort should be made to avoid annoying customers but it is important that the funds are received from the receivables without undue delay. It is a matter of balance and will be influenced by the past experience with each individual customer. This would mean that a more lenient approach could be adopted if it is known that the customer is experiencing short-term problems. It is possible that a sympathetic approach could lead to customer loyalty and also ensure that the cash is collected, which is the real purpose of the credit control section of the accounting department.<br /> Once the legal process is used to recover the debt, it is unlikely that the customer will purchase from the business again. This means that the customer is lost but this benefits the business as they are clearly an unsuitable customer.</p>
