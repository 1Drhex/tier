            <p class="blog">T is a manufacturing entity which produces several product ranges at a number of factories spread across the country.<br /> The directors of T have asked for your advice on the following issues relating to tangible non-current assets.<br /> (i) The entity is in the process of building a new factory. T is required to pay for the construction work in instalments throughout the building work. T has arranged a loan to cover the cost of the new factory. The directors are unsure whether they should capitalise the interest costs as part of the cost of the factory.<br /> (ii) The entity has a production line in an existing factory. This line is used to manufacture a product which has a declining market. The production line has a net book value of $2.3m. The line could be dismantled and sold for $0.9 m. T’s accountants have estimated that if the production line is retained, it will generate net cash flows worth $1.1m to the entity. The directors are unsure whether an impairment has occurred on this asset and, if so, how the asset should be valued.<br /> (iii) The directors are concerned about the valuation of the entity’s delivery vehicle engine division. This division has three factories in different parts of the entity. The capacity of all three factories taken together exceeds demand for the engines that the entity makes. However, there is insufficient slack capacity to enable the entity to close down even one of the factories. The directors are unsure how to identify the income-generating unit for the delivery vehicle engine division.</p> <p class="blog">Requirements<br /> (a) Describe the arguments both for and against the capitalisation of interest charges on the construction of non-current assets. Explain why IAS 23 Borrowing Costs requires consistency in this area, even though it does not specify a correct treatment.<br /> (b) Calculate the value that should appear in respect of the book value of the production line in</p> <p class="blog">(ii) above. Your answer should reflect the requirements of IAS 35 Impairment of Assets.<br /> (c) Identify the income-generating unit associated with the delivery vehicle engine division and explain why IAS 36 Impairment of Assets has created the concept of the incomegenerating unit.</p>

(a) The arguments in favour of capitalising borrowing costs are largely related to the fact that the construction of a major non-current asset will frequently be financed by a loan which can, therefore, be seen to be directly attributable to the construction project. This means that the entity could view the costs of financing the construction to be just as much a part of the project as the costs of the labour or the building materials.<br /> It might also be argued that those contractors who do not require progress payments will include their financing costs in the final contract price. This means that failure to capitalise finance costs when they arise will lead to inconsistency between assets.<br /> The arguments against capitalisation include the illogical nature of the distinction between interest paid on the loan while the asset is being constructed and that paid on the same loan on the same asset once the construction phase has been completed and the asset is in use.<br /> It can also be argued that interest is a period cost that should be treated as an expense regardless of the reason for the underlying borrowing.<br /> IAS 23 Borrowing Costs permits entities either to capitalise borrowing costs during construction or charge it as an expensive in the income statement. IAS 23 does,however, require that there is consistency of treatment between assets. Otherwise, entities could manipulate their income statements and balance sheets by selectively capitalising some costs and expensing others as and when it suited.<br /> (b) IAS 36 requires that the asset should be written down if its underlying value is less than book value. The underlying value is effectively what the asset is worth to the entity. The production line is worth $1.1m if it is kept and used for manufacturing purposes or $0.9m if it is sold. Logically, the asset will be worth more if it is kept and used and so that is the most logical basis on which to value it. Thus, the asset has suffered an impairment in value because the books attach a value<br /> of $2.3m to it even though it is worth only $1.1m. It should, therefore, be written down to $1.1m.<br /> (c) IAS 36 defines a cash-generating unit as the smallest group of assets which generates cash that is largely independent of the entity’s other cash streams. In that case, the individual engine factories are not independent cash-generating units in their own right because the output from each will be affected by the entity’s production schedules for the other two factories. Presumably, the entity makes these decisions on the basis of efficient use of resources and minimisation of costs.<br /> This means that the division as a whole is the cash-generating unit in this case.<br /> It is necessary to have the concept of the cash-generating unit because otherwise it would be impossible to place a value on the entity’s assets. For example, it would be impossible to tell how much income could be generated by a factory’s fire alarm. All that the entity could tell is that it would be illegal to operate without an adequate safety system and so the value of the alarm would have to be considered in the context of the value of the factory as a whole.</p>
