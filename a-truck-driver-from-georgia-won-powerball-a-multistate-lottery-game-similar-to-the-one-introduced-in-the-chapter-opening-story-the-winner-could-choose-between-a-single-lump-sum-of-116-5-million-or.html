            <p class="blog">A truck driver from Georgia won Powerball, a multistate lottery game similar to the one introduced in the chapter opening story. The winner could choose between a single lump sum of $116.5 million or a total of $195 million paid out over 20 annual installments (or $9.75 million per year and the first installment being paid out immediately). The truck driver opted for the lump sum.

<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> If the winner could invest his money at 8% annual interest, what is the lump‐sum amount that would make him indifferent to each payment plan? (See Figure 2.22 .)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">P = $9.75 + $9.75(P/A, 8%, 19) = $9.75 + $93.64</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $103.39 million.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= PV(8%, 20, 9.75, , 1) = -$103.39 million.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>COMMENTS:</strong> Clearly, we can tell the winner that giving up $9.75 million a year for 20 years to receive $116.5 million today is a winning proposition if he can earn an 8% return on its investment. At this point, we may be interested in knowing the minimum rate of return at which accepting the $116.5 million lump sum would make sense. Since we know that P = $116.5 million, N = 19 and A = $9.75 million, we solve for i .</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">$116.5 = $9.75 + $9.75(P/A, i, 19)</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">(P/A, i, 19) = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{\$ 116.5 &#8211; \$ 9.75}{\$ 9.75} \)</span>= 10.9487.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you know the cash flows and the present value (or future value) of a cash flow stream, you can determine the interest rate. In this case, we are looking for the interest rate that causes the P/A factor to equal (P/A, i, 19) = 10.9487. Since we are dealing with an annuity due, we could proceed as follows:<br /> • With a financial calculator, enter N = 19,P = -106.75, and A = 9.75, and then press the i key to find that i = 6.2436%. For a typical financial calculator, the symbols such as PV, PMT, and FV are commonly adopted on its keypad. These symbols correspond to PV = P,PMT = A, and FV = F, respectively. Note that, just as with Excel, either P or A must be entered as a negative number to evaluate i correctly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• If you want to use the compound-interest tables, look up the values of ( P / A, i, 19) that are closest to 10.9487. In the P/A column with N = 19 in Appendix B (page 631), you will find that (P/A, 6%, 19) = 11.1581 and (P/A, 7%, 19) = 10.3356. Then, we may approximate i by a linear interpolation as shown in Table 2.5 :</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(i \cong 7 \% &#8211; (1 \%)\frac{10.9487 &#8211; 10.3356}{11.1581 &#8211; 10.3356} = 7 \% &#8211; (1 \%)\frac{0.6131}{0.8225}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= 6.2546%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• In Excel, simply apply the following command to solve the unknown‐interest‐rate problem for an annuity:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= RATE(N, A, P, F, type, guess)<br /> = RATE(19, 9.75, -106.75, 0, 0, 5%)<br /> = 6.2436%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
As long as the lottery winner can find a financial investment that provides a rate of return higher than 6.2436%, his decision to go with the lump‐sum payment option appears to be a sound one. Table 2.6 illustrates why the lump-sum amount (calculated at $116.5 million) deposited at an interest rate of 6.2436% is equivalent to receiving 20 installments of $9.75 million. In other words, if you deposit the lumpsum amount today in a bank account that pays 6.2436% annual interest, you will be able to withdraw $9.75 million annually over 19 years. At the end of that time, your bank account will show a zero balance.</p>
