A 10% per year time value of money has been used previously to determine P, F, and A values. Now the president would like the answers to a couple of new questions about the estimated annual revenues. Use tabulated values, factor formulas, or spreadsheet functions to provide the answers.<br /> (a) What is the equivalent future worth of the estimated revenues after 5 years at 10% per year?<br /> (b) Assume that, due to the economic downturn, the president predicts that the corporation will earn only 4.5% per year on its money, not the previously anticipated 10% per year.<br /> What is the required amount of the annual revenue series over the 5-year period to be economically equivalent to the amount calculated in (a)?</p>

(a) Figure 2–6b is the cash flow diagram with A = $50 million. Note that the last A value and F = ? both occur at the end of year n = 5. We use tabulated values and the spreadsheet function to find F in year 5.<br /> <em>Tabulated value</em>: Use the F∕A factor and 10% interest factor table. In $1 million units, the future worth of the revenue series is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">F = 50(F∕A,10%,5) = 50(6.1051)<br /> = $305.255 ($305,255,000)</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the rate of return on the annual revenues were 0%, the total amount after 5 years would be $250,000,000. The 10% per year return is projected to grow this value by 22%.<br /> <em>Spreadsheet</em>: Apply the FV factor in the format = −FV(10%,5,50) to determine F = $305.255 million. Because there is no present amount in this computation, P is omitted from the factor. See Figure 2–8, left side. (As before, the minus sign forces the FV function to result in a positive value.)</p>

(b) The president of the Italian company planning to develop the steel plant is getting worried about the international economy. He wants the revenue stream to generate the equivalent that it would at a 10% per year return, that is, $305.255 million, but thinks that only a 4.5% per year return is achievable.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Factor formula</em>: The A∕F factor will determine the required A for 5 years. Since the factor tables do not include 4.5%, use the formula to answer the question. In $1 million units,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(A=305.255(A/F,4.5\%,5)=305.255\left[\frac{0.045 } {(1.045)^{5}-1} \right] =305.255(0.18279)=\$55.798\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The annual revenue requirement grows from $50 million to nearly $55,800,000. This is a significant increase of 11.6% each year.<br /> <em>Spreadsheet</em>: It is easy to answer this question by using the = PMT(i%,n,,F) function with i = 4.5% and F = $305.255 found in part (a). We can use the cell reference method (described in Appendix A) for the future amount F. Figure 2–8, right side, displays the required A of $55.798 per year (in $1 million units).</p>
