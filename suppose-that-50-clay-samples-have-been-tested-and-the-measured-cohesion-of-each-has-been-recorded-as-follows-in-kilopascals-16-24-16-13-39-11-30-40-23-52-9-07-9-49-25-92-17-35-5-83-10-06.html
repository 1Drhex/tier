The best way to determine the form of a distribution suggested by some data set is to plot a histogram. For this, it is useful to sort the data from smallest to largest:</p>
 <p class="blog">
5.83, 8.71, 9.07, 9.09, 9.49, 10.06, 10.27, 12.49, 13.33, 14.08, 14.45, 14.55, 14.82, 14.89, 15.19, 15.93, 16.00, 16.07, 16.13, 16.24, 16.59, 16.99, 17.11, 17.35, 17.76, 17.82, 17.85, 18.10, 18.15, 18.74, 18.88, 19.51, 20.74, 20.83, 21.27, 21.92, 22.94, 23.52, 25.92, 27.30, 27.38, 29.45, 29.82, 30.40, 32.96, 36.15, 36.87, 39.11, 39.25, 42.06</p>
 <p class="blog">
Suppose that we choose k = 10 intervals. We could subdivide the observed range evenly into 10 intervals between 5.83 and 42.06. This yields the histogram in Figure 5.4, whose shape is reasonably similar to that of a lognormal distribution.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because a lognormal distribution is skewed to the right, observed values from this distribution will sometimes be quite large. When an exceptionally large observation occurs in a data set, subdividing the histogram evenly between <span class="tex-text">\(x_{\min }\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(x_{\max }\)</span> may not produce a very useful histogram, since many of the rightmost intervals (except the last) may be empty. To avoid this, it is generally better to subdivide the histogram range in the space of ln(x), henceforth called log space, rather than x itself. That is, we now choose to have 10 intervals evenly dividing the interval between <span class="tex-text">\(\ln (5.83)=1.763 \text { and } \ln (42.06)=3.739\)</span>. Each interval is of width (3.739 − 1.763)/10 = 0.198 in log space. To count the number of occurrences in each interval, we need to first transform our observations by taking their natural logarithms:</p>
 <p class="blog">
1.763, 2.164, 2.205, 2.207, 2.250, 2.309, 2.329, 2.525, 2.590, 2.645, 2.671, 2.677, 2.696, 2.701, 2.721, 2.768, 2.773, 2.777, 2.781, 2.788, 2.809, 2.833, 2.839, 2.854, 2.877, 2.880, 2.882, 2.896, 2.899, 2.930, 2.938, 2.971, 3.032, 3.036, 3.057, 3.088, 3.133, 3.158, 3.255, 3.307, 3.310, 3.383, 3.395, 3.415, 3.495, 3.587, 3.607, 3.666, 3.670, 3.739</p>
 <p class="blog">
The first histogram interval goes from 1.763 to 1.763 + 0.198 = 1.961 and contains just one observation, ln(5.83) = 1.763. The second interval goes from 1.961 to 1.961 + 0.198 = 2.159 and contains zero observations. The third interval goes from 2.159 to 2.357 and contains six observations, and so on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To plot the resulting histogram in real space, we must convert the intervals back to real space. Thus, the first interval goes from <span class="tex-text">\(e^{1.763}=5.83 \text { to } e^{1.961}=7.11\)</span>, the second interval goes from 7.11 to <span class="tex-text">\(e^{2.159}=8.66\)</span>, and so on.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The only remaining complication occurs if we want to normalize the histogram so that it encloses unit area. In this case we must divide each frequency count by <span class="tex-text">\(n \Delta x_{i}\)</span>, where <span class="tex-text">\(n=50 \text { and } \Delta x_{1}=7.11-5.83=1.28\)</span> for the first interval. Thus, the normalized height of the first interval is <span class="tex-text">\(1 /(50 \times 1.28)=0.0156\)</span>. The second interval has width <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x_{2}=8.66-7.11=1.55\)</span>, while the third interval has width <span class="tex-text">\(\Delta x_{3}=e^{2.357}-e^{2.159}=10.56-8.66=1.90\)</span>. Notice that the intervals get gradually wider as we move to the right. The normalized height of the third interval is therefore <span class="tex-text">\(6 /(50 \times 1.90)=0.0632\)</span>. The resulting histogram appears as in Figure 5.5.</p>
 <p class="blog">
First of all we notice that Figures 5.4 and 5.5 are quite different. This emphasizes the fact that the shape of a histogram is often very dependent on the number and size of the selected intervals. In the case of this particular data set, the even spacing of intervals in real space appears to give a smoother and more lognormal-looking histogram.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Although the fairly erratic histogram shown in Figure 5.5 does not appear strongly lognormally shaped, we shall see later that the Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit test does not reject the hypothesis that it does in fact come from a lognormal distribution. To illustrate the comparison, we have superimposed a lognormal distribution curve (solid line) having estimated parameters</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(\begin{aligned}\hat{\mu}_{\ln X} &amp;=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln x_{i} \\&amp;=\frac{1}{50}(1.763+2.164+\cdots+3.739) \\&amp;=2.91 \\\hat{\sigma}_{\ln X} &amp;=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\ln x_{i}-\hat{\mu}_{\ln X}\right)^{2}} \\&amp;=0.43\end{aligned}\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
In either the continuous or discrete case, there should be good agreement between the empirical (i.e., observed) and the fitted functions. The degree of agreement between the functions is sometimes difficult to assess, particularly for small n, but the following types of probability plots should help.</p>
