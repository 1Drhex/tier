       <title>The group of pure rotations (excluding reflections and inversions) that take a cube into itself has 24 elements. The group is isomorphic to the permutation group {S}_{4} and hence has the same character table, once corresponding classes have been established. By counting the number of elements in each class, make the correspondences below (the final two cannot be decided purely by counting, and should be taken as given). Given in table 29.1 is the character table for {S}_{4}. Reformulate it in terms of the elements of the rotation symmetry group (432 or O) of a cube and use it when answering exercise 29.7.

The rotational symmetries of the cube are as follows.<br /> (i) ‘Do nothing’. There is only one such operation; it is the identity and so corresponds to (1) ≡ (1)(2)(3)(4).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Table 29.1</p>
 <p class="blog">
(ii) Rotations about a body diagonal. There are four body diagonals and rotations of 2π/3 and 4π/3 are possible about each. Thus there are eight elements and this must correspond to (123) ≡ (123)(4).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(iii) Rotations by π about a face normal. Although there are six faces to the cube, they define only three distinct face normals and hence there are three elements in this set. They therefore correspond to (12)(34).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(iv) Rotations of π/2 and 3π/2 about a face normal. With three distinct face normals and two possible rotation angles for each, the set contains six elements. These could correspond to (12) ≡ (12)(3)(4) or to (1234).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(v) Rotations of π about axes that join the centres of opposite edges. There are six such axes and hence six elements. As in (iv), these could correspond to<br /> (12) ≡ (12)(3)(4) or to (1234).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Taking the identification given in the question for (iv) and (v), the reformulated<br /> table (in which only the headings have changed) is given in table 29.2.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We note that the rotational symmetries of a cube can, alternatively, be characterised by the effects they have on the orientations in space of its four body diagonals. For example, a rotation of π about a face normal interchanges them in pairs – represented in cycle notation by the form (12)(34). Using this formulation of the symmetry group, the assignments for (iv) and (v) are unambiguous.</p>
