            <p class="blog">Assigning School Buses to Routes at Spring View</p> <p class="blog">The city of Spring View is taking bids from six bus companies on the eight routes that must be driven in the surrounding school district. Each company enters a bid of how much it will charge to drive selected routes, although not all companies bid on all routes. The data are listed in Table 5.4. (If a company does not bid on a route, the corresponding entry is blank.) The city must decide which companies to assign to which routes with the specifications that (1) if a company does not bid on a route, it cannot be assigned to that route; (2) exactly one company must be assigned to each route; and (3) a company can be assigned to at most two routes. The objective is to minimize the total cost of covering all routes.</p> <p class="blog">Table 5.4 Bids on Bus Routes:</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" border="0" width="648" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td dir="LTR" width="72" height="19">Route 8</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 7</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 6</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 5</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 4</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 3</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 2</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Route 1</td> <td dir="LTR" width="72">Company</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">3900</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">5400</td> <td dir="LTR">7800</td> <td dir="LTR">8200</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19"></td> <td dir="LTR">4900</td> <td dir="LTR">3300</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">6300</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">8200</td> <td dir="LTR">7800</td> <td dir="LTR">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19">3600</td> <td dir="LTR">5600</td> <td dir="LTR">4400</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">4800</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19">4200</td> <td dir="LTR">6700</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">6800</td> <td dir="LTR">5000</td> <td dir="LTR">8000</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">4</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19">3000</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">2800</td> <td dir="LTR">6400</td> <td dir="LTR">3900</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">6400</td> <td dir="LTR">7200</td> <td dir="LTR">5</td> </tr> <tr> <td dir="LTR" height="19">4200</td> <td dir="LTR">6000</td> <td dir="LTR"></td> <td dir="LTR">5600</td> <td dir="LTR">4500</td> <td dir="LTR">7500</td> <td dir="LTR">5800</td> <td dir="LTR">7000</td> <td dir="LTR">6</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use a network model to assign companies to bus routes so that each route is covered at minimum cost to the city and no company is assigned to more than two routes.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> This is straightforward.

The variables and constraints for this model appear in Figure 5.15. (See the file Bus Routes Big Picture.xlsx.) Again, you can see how similar the structure is to the typical assignment model and the basic transportation model. As in the machine- to-job assignment model in Figure 5.14, the decision variable cells will all contain 0’s and 1’s, where the 1’s indicate which assignments are made.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can model this problem in the “network” way. Although the rather large network is not shown, you can imagine nodes for the bus companies on the left, nodes for the bus routes on the right, and all arrows going from left to right. All flows are 0 or 1—a company is either assigned to a bus route or it isn’t. The constraint that a company can be assigned to at most two bus routes is handled by constraining the outflow from any company node to be at most 2. To ensure that each bus route is covered by exactly one company, the inflow to each bus route node is constrained to equal 1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> Because this is essentially a transportation model (with some disallowed arcs, the ones where a company doesn’t bid on a route), you could mimic the transportation models in Figure 5.3 and Figure 5.14, or you could mimic the more general model in Figure 5.8. For efficiency, the latter is chosen here. This actually has two advantages. It doesn’t force you to include decision variable cells for disallowed assignments, and it gets you ready for the more general network model in the next section.<br /> The model appears in Figure 5.16. (See the file Bus Routes Finished.xlsx.) Because this model is so similar to the Grand Prix transportation model in Figure 5.8, not all of the details are repeated here. The key steps are as follows. (For help on the SUMIF function, revisit the discussion of the alternative model in .)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1) Arc lists. The list of arcs (company–bus route pairs) in rows 8 to 38 corresponds to the nonblank cells in Table 5.4. There is no point in including arcs that correspond to disallowed assignments. Enter the data in columns A and B manually, referring to Table 5.4.<br /> 2) Inputs. Enter the costs from the (nonblank) cells in Table 5.4 in the range C8:C38. Also, enter the maximum number of routes per company in cell B4.<br /> 3) Assignments. Enter any values in the Flow range. Although these will eventually be 0’s and 1’s to indicate which assignments are made, any values can be used initially. Solver will eventually find the optimal values.<br /> 4) Inflows and outflows. Column G contains outflows (numbers of routes assigned) for company nodes and inflows (numbers of companies assigned) for bus route nodes. To calculate these, enter the formulas<br /> =SUMIF(Origin,F8,Flow)<br /> and</p>
 <p class="blog">
=SUMIF(Destination,F16,Flow)<br /> in cells G8 and G16, respectively, and copy them down their respective ranges.<br /> 5) Requirements on flows. Enter a link to cell B4 in each cell of the range I8:I13. This is used to prevent any company from being assigned to more than two routes. Also, enter 1 in each cell of the range I16:I23 to reflect that each route must be assigned to exactly one company.<br /> 6) Total cost. Calculate the total cost to the city in cell B41 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Cost,Flow)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup should appear as in Figure 5.17. As usual, check the Non-Negative option and select the Simplex LP method before optimizing.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The optimal solution in Figure 5.16 indicates that the city should make the following assignments: company 1 covers bus route 3, company 2 covers bus routes 6 and 7, company 3 covers bus route 2, company 5 covers bus routes 4 and 8, and company 6 covers bus routes 1 and 5. The total cost to the city of this assignment is $40,300. Note that company 4 is not assigned to any bus routes. There is no constraint that every company must be assigned to at least one bus route, and company 4 is evidently underbid by at least one company for all bus routes. If the city wanted to require that all companies be assigned to at least one bus route, you would simply add a lower bound of 1 on all of the outflows from the company nodes (in rows 8 to 13). This would probably increase the total cost to the city.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong><br /> One interesting sensitivity analysis is to see what effect the upper bound constraint on the maximum routes has on the total cost. Presumably, if more bus routes per company are allowed (assuming this is physically possible and safe), the companies who tend to bid lowest will be assigned to the bulk of the bus routes, and the total cost will probably decrease. Using SolverTable, the analysis itself is straightforward with no modifications to the model necessary. You should specify cell B4 as the single input cell, allow it to vary, say, from 1 to 7 in increments of 1, and keep track of total cost. The resulting output appears in Figure 5.18.<br /> If each company can be assigned to only one route, there is no feasible solution. This is because there are eight routes to cover and only six companies. For larger values of the maximum routes allowed, the total cost begins to decrease, but only until this input value reaches 3. From this point, the city achieves no additional flexibility by allowing companies to travel more routes. Evidently, there is no single company or pair of companies that is consistently underbidding all others.</p>
