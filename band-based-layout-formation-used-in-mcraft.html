Consider the same data given for . Unlike CRAFT (where the user selects the grid size), MCRAFT asks for the length and width of the building and the number of bands.<br /> The program then computes the appropriate grid size and the resulting number of rows and columns in the layout. Thus, setting the building length (width) equal to 360 feet (200 feet), and the number of bands equal to, say, three, we obtain the initial layout shown in Figure 6.20,<br /> where each band is six rows wide. MCRAFT forms a layout by starting at the upper-lefthand corner of the building and “sweeping” the bands in a serpentine fashion. In doing so, it follows a particular sequence of department numbers, which we will refer to as the layout vector or the fill sequence. The layout shown in Figure 6.20 was obtained from the layout vector 1-7-5-3-2-4-8-6, which is supplied by the user as the initial layout vector. (Note that MCRAFT designates the departments by numbers instead of letters; department 1 represents department<br /> A, department 2 represents department B, etc.)<br /> MCRAFT performs four iterations (i.e., four two-way exchanges) before terminating with the two-opt layout. The departments exchanged at each iteration and the corresponding layout cost are given as follows: first iteration—departments C and E (59,611.11 units); second iteration—departments C and H (58,083.34 units); third iteration—departments C and D (57,483.34 units); and fourth iteration—departments B and C (57,333.34 units). The resulting three-band layout is shown in Figure 6.21, for which the layout vector is given by 1-7-8-5-3-2- 4-6. Except for department 2, the departments in Figure 6.21 appear to have reasonable<br /> shapes. Unlike CRAFT, the department shapes obtained from the sweep method tend to be reasonable if an appropriate number of bands is selected. Of course, alternative initial and final layouts may be generated by varying the number of bands and the initial layout vector.<br /> Due to the above layout formation technique, MCRAFT cannot capture the initial layout accurately unless the departments are already arranged in bands. As a result, one may have to massage the initial layout to make it compatible with</p>

MCRAFT. (The reader may compare the original initial layout shown in Figure 6.15 with MCRAFT’s initial layout shown in Figure 6.20.) The actual cost of the initial layout as computed by CRAFT is equal to 2974 ×20= 59,480 units, whereas MCRAFT’s initial layout cost is equal to 60,661.11 units—a relatively small difference considering the fact that the “actual” layout used by CRAFT is itself an approximation of reality. Based on the number of departments and the actual initial layout,<br /> however, the above difference may be significant for some problems.<br /> Another limitation of the sweep method used in MCRAFT is that the band width is assumed to be the same for all the bands. As a result, MCRAFT is generally not as effective as CRAFT in treating obstacles and fixed departments. If there is an obstacle in the building, the analyst must ensure that its width does not exceed the band width. Otherwise, the obstacle must be divided into two or more pieces, which is likely to further complicate matters. In addition, while it is straightforward<br /> in MCRAFT to fix the location of any department, a fixed department may still “shift” or “float” when certain non-equal-area departments are exchanged.<br /> In the above example, the two fixed departments (1 and 7) remained at their current locations since they are the first two departments in the initial layout vector 1-7-5-3-2-4-8-6. However, if we fix, say, department 2 in Figure 6.20, and the algorithm exchanges departments 3 and 4, then the location of department 2 will shift when the layout is formed with the new layout vector. (Why?) In general, when two unequal-area<br /> departments are exchanged, the location of a fixed department will shift if the two departments fall on either side of the fixed department in the layout vector. Considering that obstacles are also modeled as fixed departments (with zero flow), the above limitation implies that obstacles may shift as well. It is instructive to note that MCRAFT’s primary strength (i.e., being able to “automatically” shift other departments as necessary) is also its primary weakness (i.e., fixed departments and obstacles may also be shifted).</p>
