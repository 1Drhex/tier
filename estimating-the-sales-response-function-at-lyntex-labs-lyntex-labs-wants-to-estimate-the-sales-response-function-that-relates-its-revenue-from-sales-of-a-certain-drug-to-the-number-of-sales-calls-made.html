            <p class="blog">Estimating the Sales Response Function at Lyntex Labs<br /> Lyntex Labs wants to estimate the sales response function that relates its revenue from sales of a certain drug to the number of sales calls made. Company experts estimate the revenue that would be obtained in the following five scenarios:<br /> ■■ No sales effort is assigned to the drug.<br /> ■■ Sales effort assigned to the drug is cut in half.<br /> ■■ Sales force effort stays at the current level.<br /> ■■ Sales force effort is increased by 50%.<br /> ■■ Sales force effort saturates the market.</p> <p class="blog">The resulting estimates appear in Table 8.3. Note that the current sales effort is 350,000 sales calls. Also, all sales revenue estimates are expressed relative to an index of 100, where 100 represents the current level of sales revenue. For example, the experts estimate that if sales effort is cut in half, sales revenue from the drug will decrease to 68% of the current level. Lyntex assumes that its sales revenue function is of the form in Equation (8.1). It wants to find the constants a, b, c, and d that provide the best fit to the values in Table 8.3.</p> <p class="blog">Table 8.3 Estimated Sales Revenues:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  dir="RTL" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 334px; height: 161px;" border="0" width="144" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt; width: 54pt;" width="72" height="19">Sales Revenue</td> <td dir="LTR" style="width: 54pt;" width="72">Sales Calls (1000s)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">47</td> <td dir="LTR">0</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">68</td> <td dir="LTR">175</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">100</td> <td dir="LTR">350</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">126</td> <td dir="LTR">525</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.25pt;"> <td dir="LTR" style="height: 14.25pt;" height="19">152</td> <td dir="LTR">3500</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To use Evolutionary Solver to estimate the assumed S-shaped relationship between revenue and sales force effort, as measured by the number of sales calls.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The required data in Table 8.3 could be historical data, based on various levels of sales force effort the company has used in the past, or, as suggested in the problem statement, they could be educated guesses by people in the marketing department.</p>

The model development is basically the same as for  from the previous chapter. See Figure 8.22 and the file Sales Response Finished.xlsx. The objective is again to find the model parameters that minimize the sum of squared errors between the actual revenues and the revenues predicted from the sales response function.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> To develop the spreadsheet model, use the following steps:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the data in the light blue region from Table 8.3.<br /> 2) Decision variables. The only decision variables are the constants a, b, c, and d of the sales response function. Enter any values for these. Note that we tried to name corresponding cells a, b, c, and d. However, Excel doesn’t allow the range name c. (It also doesn’t allow the range name r.) Instead, it changes this name to c_.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3) Predicted sales revenues. In column D, calculate the sales revenue levels (remember that these are relative to 100) predicted from Equation (8.1). To do so, enter the formula =a+((b-a)*B11^c_)/(d+B11^c_)<br /> in cell D11 and copy it down to cell D15.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(R = a +\frac {(b-a)E^{c}}{d+E^{c}}\)</span> (8.1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4) Prediction errors. For a good fit, the predictions in column D should match the experts’ estimates in column C as closely as possible. As usual, a good way to do this is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the two columns. First, calculate the errors in column E by entering<br /> the formula<br /> =C11-D11<br /> in cell E11 and copying down. Then calculate the sum of squared errors in cell B17 with the formula<br /> =SUMSQ(E11:E15)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> No IF, ABS, MAX, or MIN functions are used in this model, so you might try GRG Nonlinear Solver, just as in the previous chapter. However, there might be local minima in this model that are not globally optimal. Alternatively, you could try the Multistart option. However, Evolutionary Solver is also a good choice because it searches the entire feasibleregion and is less likely to get stuck at a local minimum. The only problem is to find a decent starting solution and reasonable lower and upper limits for the decision variable cells. It is difficult to tell, just by looking at Equation (8.1), what reasonable values for a, b, c, and d might be. Must they be positive? How large can they be? The answers are certainly not obvious.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Therefore, some analysis of Equation (8.1) is useful before turning to Evolutionary Solver. First, note that when E 5 0, estimated sales R equals a. Therefore, a should be positive. Second, the fraction in Equation (8.1) approaches b – a as E gets large, so b is the limiting value of R as E gets large. Third, Ec should increase when E increases, so that R will increase with E. This occurs only if c is positive. Finally, to keep the denominator positive for all values of E, d must be positive.If this quick analysis is not convincing, another strategy is to graph Equation (8.1) and then watch how the graph changes as you manually change a, b, c, and d (see Figure 8.23).</p>
 <p class="blog">
This chart is a scatter chart (where the points are connected with lines) that plots the actual sales (the experts’ estimates) in column C and the predicted values from the sales response function in column D. By changing the constants in row 4 and seeing when the fit between the two curves is fairly good, you can quickly see that a should be around 47, b should be somewhere between 150 and 160, the exponent c should be somewhere 1.5 and 5, and the constant d should be a large positive number. These are fairly wide ranges, but all we want at this point is to find reasonable lower and upper limits for Evolutionary Solver. Using this (somewhat inexact) information, you should fill in the Solver dialog box as shown in Figure 8.24.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The best solution found by Evolutionary Solver appears earlier in Figure 8.22. Unfortunately, there is nothing very intuitive about these particular values of a, b, c, and d. However, if you substitute them into row 4 of Figure 8.23, you will see that they provide a very good fit. In other words, the sales response function with these parameters should provide very useful predictions of sales levels.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is interesting to compare Evolutionary Solver with GRG Nonlinear Solver (without using the Multistart option) for this smooth model. For example, we started each of them at a fairly poor solution: a=40, b=100, c=1, and d=5000. (The sum of squared errors for this solution is almost 18,000.) Evolutionary Solver found the solution in Figure 8.22 almost immediately. GRG Nonlinear Solver also found a solution almost immediately, but it was the wrong solution. Its objective was about 190, well above the minimum value in Figure 8.22. Again, this is because Evolutionary Solver does a more thorough job of searching the entire feasible region and not getting stuck at a local minimum. (To be fair,GRG Nonlinear Solver with the Multistart option also found the solution quickly, even after starting from the poor solution.)</p>
