1. Show his consumer equilibrium before he receives the scholarship. When Enrico had no unearned income from the scholarship, his budget constraint, <span class="tex-text">\(L^{1}\)</span> in the graphs, hit the hours-leisure axis at 0 hours and had a slope of -ω.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Show how the unearned income affects his budget constraint. The extra income causes a parallel upward shift of his budget constraint by Y*. His new budget constraint, <span class="tex-text">\(L^{2}\)</span>, has the same slope as before, -ω, because his wage does not change. The extra income cannot buy Enrico more time, of course, so <span class="tex-text">\(L^{2}\)</span> cannot extend to the right of the time constraint. It hits the vertical time constraint at Y*: If he works no hours, he has Y* income.<br /> 3. Show that the relative position of the new to the original equilibrium depends on his tastes. The change in the number of hours he works depends on Enrico’s tastes. Panels a and b show two possible sets of indifference curves. In both diagrams, when facing budget constraint <span class="tex-text">\(L^{1}\)</span>, Enrico chooses to work <span class="tex-text">\(H_{1}\)</span> hours. In panel a, leisure is a normal good, so as his income rises, Enrico consumes more leisure: He moves from Bundle <span class="tex-text">\(e_{1}\)</span> to Bundle <span class="tex-text">\(e_{2}\)</span>. In panel b, he views leisure as an inferior good and consumes fewer hours of leisure than at first: He moves from <span class="tex-text">\(e_{1}\)</span>to <span class="tex-text">\(e_{3}\)</span>. (Another possibility is that the number of hours he works is unaffected by the extra unearned income.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Discuss how his utility changes. Regardless of his tastes, Enrico has more income in the new equilibrium and is on a higher indifference curve after receiving the scholarship. In short, he believes that more money is better than less.</p>
