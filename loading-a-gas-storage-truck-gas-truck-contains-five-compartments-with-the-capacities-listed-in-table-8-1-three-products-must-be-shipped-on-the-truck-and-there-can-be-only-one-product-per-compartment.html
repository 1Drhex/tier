The variables for this problem are shown in Figure 8.12. (See the file Loading Truck Big Picture.xlsx.) The objective is to minimize the total shortage cost. The decision variables indicate the type of product stored in each compartment and the amount of that product to load in the compartment. The constraints must ensure that no compartment is overfilled and that the maximum allowable shortage is not exceeded. More specifically, the model assumes that costs are incurred for all shortages, using the shortage costs in the last column of Table 8.2. However, the company doesnâ€™t want the shortages to exceed the maximum shortages allowed. As you will see, this last constraint is handled with a penalty cost.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed model appears in Figure 8.13. (See the file Loading Truck Finished.xlsx.) It can be developed as follows:<br /> 1) Inputs. Enter the inputs from Tables 8.1 and 8.2 into the light blue ranges.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2) Decision variables. Enter any integer values (from 1 to 3) in the Product range and any values (integer or noninteger) in the Amount range. These two ranges represent the decision variable cells.<br /> 3) Amounts stored total. To calculate the gallons of each product stored on the truck from the values in the decision variable cells, you can use the SUMIF function. Specifically, enter the formula<br /> =SUMIF(Product,A21,Amount)</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell B21. This formula sums the values in the Amount range for all rows where the product index, 1, in cell A21 matches the index in the Product range. Therefore, it calculates the total amount of product 1 stored on the truck. Copy this formula down for the other two products.<br /> 4) Shortages. To calculate the shortages, enter the formula<br /> =IF(B21&lt;C21,C21-B21,0)<br /> in cell D21 and copy it down. Note that shortages were discussed in previous chapters, but they always required some tricks to keep the models linear. Now you can use straightforward IF functions, which present no difficulty for Evolutionary Solver.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5) Shortage violations. You could constrain the shortages to be less than the maximum allowable shortages, but because the Evolutionary Solver works best with as few constraints as possible, there is a better approach. (This approach is used in the following example as well.) You can calculate the amount by which each maximum storage constraint is violated (if at all) and then add these violations, multiplied by a suitably large penalty, to the cost objective. Because the objective is to minimize total cost, Evolutionary Solver tries to stay away from solutions where this penalty is positive. Therefore, it favors solutions where the maximum storage constraints are satisfied. To implement this strategy, calculate the maximum storage violations in column F by entering the formula<br /> =IF(D21&gt;E21,D21-E21,0)<br /> in cell F21 and copying it down. The solution shown in Figure 8.13 does not have any violations, but the values in column F would be positive if any shortages in column D were greater than 900.</p>
 <p class="blog">
6) Costs. Calculate the total shortage cost in cell B26 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(B5:B7,D21:D23)<br /> Then calculate the penalty cost from maximum shortage violations in B27 with the formula<br /> =B9*SUM(F21:F23)<br /> Note that a penalty of $100 per unit shortage above the maximum allowed was chosen. Any large dollar value would suffice here; it just depends on how much you want to penalize violations of the constraint. Finally, calculate the total cost in cell B28 by summing the values in cells B26 and B27.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Using Evolutionary Solver</strong><br /> The Solver setup for this model is straightforward, as shown in Figure 8.14. Unlike some previous models, there are now natural lower limits and upper limits for the decision variable cells. The Product range must be between 1 and 3 (and they must be integers) because there are only three products. The Amount range must be between 0 and the given capacities of the compartments.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> The solution in Figure 8.13 shows that product 1 should be stored in compartment 2, product 2 should be stored in compartments 1 and 3, and product 3 should be stored in compartments 4 and 5, the only compartments that end up with excess capacity. The demands for products 1 and 2 are not quite met, and the total shortage cost is $2600, but the shortages are well below the maximum shortages allowed. Therefore, there is no penalty cost for violating the maximum shortage constraints.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This model is not easy for Evolutionary Solver, in spite of its rather small size, and its success depends a lot on the starting solution. For example, we tried one solution with all 3â€™s in the Product range and all 1000â€™s in the Amount range. It got to a solution with objective value $3200 fairly quickly, but then it spun its wheels for a long time and never improved. In contrast, when we entered a random combination of 1, 2, and 3 in the Product range and all 0â€™s in the Amount range, the optimal solution was found very quickly.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Sensitivity Analysis with SolverTable</strong><br /> Nothing prevents you from using SolverTable on an Evolutionary Solver modelâ€”except time. You fill in the SolverTable dialog box exactly as before. The only difference is that Evolutionary Solver can take a lot of time to solve one problem, let alone a whole series of problems. Also, to provide some assurance that it does not stop prematurely at a suboptimal solution for at least one of the problems, you need to experiment with the Evolutionary Solver settings in the Options dialog boxes, because the appropriate settings are not always obvious.</p>
 <p class="blog">
We tried a sensitivity analysis on the capacity of compartment 3 for this example, allowing it to vary from 300 to 1100 in multiples of 200, and we obtained the results in Figure 8.15. We are not really sure whether these results are optimal. (The equal objective values for capacities of 700 and 900 are somewhat suspicious.) However, we ran this same SolverTable several times, with different Solver option settings and different starting solutions, and we usually obtained worse results than in Figure 8.15 on at least one problem. This is not the fault of SolverTable or even the fault of Evolutionary Solver. This storage problem, like many combinatorial problems, is difficult, and unless Evolutionary Solver is allowed to run for a very long time, it can easily get stuck at a suboptimal solution fairly far from the optimal solution. For this reason, we do not mention SolverTable again in this chapter, but there is nothing to prevent you from trying it. You just need to be patient.</p>
