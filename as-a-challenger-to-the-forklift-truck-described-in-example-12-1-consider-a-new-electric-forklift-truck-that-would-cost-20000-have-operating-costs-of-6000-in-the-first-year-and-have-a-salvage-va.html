<strong>DISSECTING THE PROBLEM</strong><br /> For an asset whose revenues are either unknown or irrelevant, we compute its economic life from the costs of the asset and its year-by-year market (salvage) values. To determine an asset’s economic service life, we need to compare the options of keeping the asset for one year, two years, three years, and so forth. The option that results in the lowest AEC gives the economic service life of the asset.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
 <p class="blog">
In this case, our examination proceeds as follows:<br /> <strong>• N = 1 (one-year replacement cycle):</strong> In this case, the machine is bought, used for one year, and sold at the end of year 1. The cash-flow diagram for this option is shown in Figure 12.4 . The annual-equivalent cost for this option is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(AEC(12 \%) = \overbrace{(\$20,000 &#8211; \$14,000)(A/P, 12 \%, 1) + (0.12)( \$14,000)}^{CR(12 \%)} + \underbrace{\$6.000}_{OC(12 \%)}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $14,400.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that (A/P, 12%, 1) = (F/P, 12%, 1) and that the annual-equivalent cost is the equivalent cost at the end of year 1, since N = 1. Because we are calculating the annual-equivalent costs, we have treated cost items with a positive sign and the salvage value with a negative sign.<br /> <strong>• N = 2 (two-year replacement cycle):</strong> In this case, the truck will be used for two years and disposed of at the end of year 2. The operating cost in year 2 is 25% higher than in year 1, and the salvage value at the end of year 2 is 30% lower than at the end of year 1. The cash-flow diagram for this option is also shown in Figure 12.4 . The annual-equivalent cost over the two-year period is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( AEC(12 \%) = \overbrace {(\$20,000 &#8211; \$9,800)(A/P, 12 \%, 2) + (0.12)( \$9,800)}^{CR(12 \%)} + \underbrace{\$6.000 + (P/A_{1}, 25 \%, 12 \%, 2)(A/P, 12 \%, 2)}_{OC(12 \%)}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $13,919.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• N = 3 (three-year replacement cycle):</strong> In this case, the truck will be used for three years and sold at the end of year 3. The salvage value at the end of year 3 is 30% lower than at the end of year 2—that is, $6,860. The operating cost per year increases at a rate of 25%. The cash-flow diagram for this option is also shown in Figure 12.4 . For this case, the annual-equivalent cost is calculated as follows:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( AEC(12 \%) = \overbrace{(\$20,000 &#8211; \$6,860)(A/P, 12 \%, 3) + (0.12)( \$6,860)}^{CR(12 \%)} + \underbrace{\$6.000 + {(P/A_{1}, 25 \%, 12 \%, 3)(A/P, 12 \%, 3)}}_{OC(12 \%)} \)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">= $13,792.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Similarly, we can find the annual-equivalent cost for the option of keeping the asset for each remaining year. The cashflow diagram for N = 8 years is shown in Figure 12.4 . The computed annual-equivalent costs over eight years are shown in Table 12.1 .</p>
 <p class="blog">
From Table 12.1 , we find that AEC (12%) is the smallest when N = 3. If the truck were to be replaced every three years, it would have an annual cost of $13,792 per year. If it were to be used for a period other than three years, the annual-equivalent costs would be higher than $13,792. Thus, a life span of three years for this truck results in the lowest annual cost. We conclude that the economic service life of the truck is three years. By replacing the assets perpetually, according to an economic life of three years, we obtain the minimum annual-equivalent cost stream. Figure 12.5 illustrates the concept of perpetual replacement for one- and two-year replacement cycles. Of course, we should envision a long period of required service for this kind of asset.</p>

<strong>METHODOLOGY </strong><br /> Create a cash-flow diagram for one-year, two-year, three-year, and eight-year replacement cycles.</p>
