Let the reactions at the pin be denoted as <span class="tex-text">\(A_{x}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(A_{y}\)</span> (note: a 2-D pin cannot resist a rotation and thus cannot supply a reaction moment) and similarly let the reaction at the roller be denoted as <span class="tex-text">\(B_{y}\)</span> (note: a roller cannot resist a horizontal motion or a rotation), each according to a positive sign convention (Fig. 1.17b). In such problems, it is best to first solve equilibrium of the whole and then equilibrium of individual parts as needed to find all of the values of interest. For overall equilibrium, we have from force balance,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F}=0\rightarrow A_{x}\hat{i}+A_{y}\hat{j}+B_{y}\hat{j}+F\hat{i}=0 \)</span> <p class="blog">
or in components,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( A_{x}+F=0\rightarrow A_{x}=-F, A_{y}+B_{y}=0\rightarrow A_{y}=-B_{y}.\)</span> <p class="blog">
Now, for moment balance, let us take moments about point A because the lines of action of two of the four forces go through A. Hence,</p>
 <p class="blog">
FIGURE 1.17 Shown is a simple 2-D truss (panel a) and associated free-body diagrams of the whole structure (panel b) and individual parts (panel c). Panel (d) shows results of the final analysis with regard to which members support tension versus compression.</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{M})_{A}=0\rightarrow 2l\hat{i}\times B_{y}\hat{j}+(l\hat{i}+l\hat{j} )\times F\hat{i}=0\rightarrow 2lB_{y}\hat{k}-lF\hat{k}=0. \)</span> <p class="blog">
From moment balance and the second force balance equations respectively, we thus have</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( B_{y}=\frac{F}{2}, A_{y}=-\frac{F}{2}.\)</span> <p class="blog">
It is reemphasized that in two dimensions, we have three scalar equations (summation of force in x and y as well as summation of moments about the z axis at any one point) to find three unknowns; if there are more unknown reactions in the overall problem, it is said to be statically indeterminate, which is to say that we need additional equations to find the reactions. The focus of Chaps. 2–5 is the development and use of such additional equations. Here, however, the reactions are now known; thus, we can consider equilibrium of the parts. Toward this end, there are two commonly used approaches: the method of pins and the method of sections. In the former, one isolates, via a free-body diagram (FBD), the pins at each joint and then enforces equilibrium at each; in the latter, one similarly isolates, via FBDs, sections of the truss and likewise enforces equilibrium. Because of the 2-D nature of each of these subproblems, one can only determine two unknowns in each. We review the method of sections here.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 1.17c shows the truss with three fictitious cuts; note that each cut crosses only two structural elements, thereby isolating only two unknown internal forces each. (Because the lines of action in each “part” go through a point, one can only enforce force balance in the x and y directions and thus solve for only two unknowns in each FBD—Why is this the case?) For the part including pin A, we have,</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{x}}=0\rightarrow AC\cos \theta +AB-F=0,\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{y}}=0\rightarrow AC\sin \theta -\frac{F}{2}=0\rightarrow AC=\frac{F 2}{2\sqrt{2} }=\frac{F}{\sqrt{2} },\)</span> <p class="blog">
where <span class="tex-text">\(\sin \theta =\sqrt{2}/2\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(\cos \theta =\sqrt{2}/2\)</span> given the geometry. From the x-direction equation, therefore, we find that <span class="tex-text">\(AB = F/2.\)</span> Similarly, for the part containing pin B, we have</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{x}}=0\rightarrow -BC\cos \theta -BA=0,\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{y}}=0\rightarrow BC\sin \theta +\frac{F}{2}=0\rightarrow BC=-\frac{F}{\sqrt{2} }\)</span> <p class="blog">
and thus from the x-direction equation, <span class="tex-text">\(BA = F/2.\)</span> Although the solution is now complete (i.e., all reactions and internal forces have been found in terms of F and l), we shall consider the part containing pin C as a consistency check. We have</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{x}}=0\rightarrow -CA\sin \theta +CB\sin \theta +F=0,\)</span> <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \sum{F_{y}}=0\rightarrow -CA\cos \theta -CB\cos \theta =0\rightarrow CA=-CB,\)</span> <p class="blog">
and thus from the x-direction equation, <span class="tex-text">\(CB=-F/\sqrt{2},\)</span> and from the y-direction equation,<span class="tex-text">\( CA=-F/\sqrt{2}.\)</span> The correctness of the solutions is thus verified by the consistency check. Finally, note that we assumed a positive sign convention (i.e., tensile load in each member) when denoting each unknown symbolically. When doing so, a positive sign for the solution of an unknown reveals that the direction was assumed correctly, whereas a negative sign reveals that the direction is actually opposite that which was assumed. Hence, as shown in Fig. 1.17d, members AB and AC are in tension and BC is in compression.</p>
