The facilities department’s first task was to estimate the annual savings that could be realized by these energy-efficiency projects. Currently, the company pays 7.80 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for electricity and $4.85 per thousand cubic feet (MCF). Assuming that the current energy prices would continue for the next eight years, the company has estimated the cash flow and the IRR for each project as follows.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="479"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="72"><strong>Project</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>Investment</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>Annual</strong><br /> <strong>O&amp;M Cost</strong></td> <td width="119"><strong>Annual Savings</strong><br /> <strong>(Energy)</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>Annual Savings</strong><br /> <strong>(Dollars)</strong></td> <td width="72"><strong>IRR</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>$46,800</td> <td>$1,200</td> <td>151,000 kWh</td> <td>$11,778</td> <td>15.43%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>104,850</td> <td>1,050</td> <td>513,077 kWh</td> <td>40,020</td> <td>33.48%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>135,480</td> <td>1,350</td> <td>6,700,000 CF</td> <td>32,495</td> <td>15.95%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>94,230</td> <td>942</td> <td>470,738 Wh</td> <td>36,718</td> <td>34.40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/08/fegure-15-5-768x558.jpg"></div>

<strong>Given:</strong> IRRs for four different energy projects.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> Optimal capital budget.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider project A4. Its IRR is 34.40%, and it can be financed with capital that costs only 14%. Consequently, it should be accepted. Projects A2 and A3 can be analyzed similarly; all are acceptable, because the IRR exceeds the marginal cost of capital. Project A1, by contrast, should be rejected, because its IRR is less than the marginal cost of capital. Therefore, the firm should accept the three projects A4, A2, and A3, which have rates of return in excess of the cost of capital that would be used to finance them if we end up with a capital budget of $334,560. This should be the amount of the optimal capital budget.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In Figure 15.5, even though two rate changes occur in the marginal cost of capital in funding project A3 (the first change is from 14.5% to 15%, the second from 15% to 15.5%), the accept–reject decision for A3 remains unchanged, as its rate of return exceeds the marginal cost of capital.</p>
 <p class="blog">
What would happen if the MCC cut through project A3? For example, suppose that the marginal cost of capital for any project raised above $300,000 would cost 16% instead of 15.5%, thereby causing the MCC schedule to cut through project A3. Should we then accept project A3? If we can take project A3 in part, we would take on only part of it up to 74.49%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> Now, if projects cannot be funded partially, how do we compare these alternatives? Consider again Figure 15.5. If we take project A1 first, it would be acceptable, because its 15.43% return would exceed the 14% cost of capital used to finance it. Why couldn’t we do this? The answer is that we are seeking to maximize the excess of returns over costs (or the area above the MCC) but below the IOS. We accomplish that by accepting the most profitable projects first. This logic leads us to conclude that, as long as the budget permits, project A4 should be selected first and project A2 second. This will consume $199,080, which leaves us $50,920 in unspent funds. The question is, “What are we going to do with this leftover money?” Certainly, it is not enough to take project A3 in full, but we can take project A1 in full. Full funding for project A1 will fit the budget, and the rate of return still exceeds the marginal cost of capital (15.43% <span class="tex-text">\(\gt\)</span> 15%). Accordingly, unless the leftover funds earn more than 15.43% interest, alternative 12 becomes the best (Figure 15.6). A more logical way to address this issue is to enumerate the number of feasible investment decision alternatives within the budget limit and come up with the list of mutually exclusive alternatives. This will be discussed in the next section.</p>
