            <p class="blog">In this section, a widely used transient benchmark problem of periodic vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder is briefly considered. The problem definition is simple and is shown in Figure 7.32. A circular cylinder of diameter D is placed in a fuid stream with a uniform approaching velocity. The computational domain inlet and exit are placed at lengths of 4 D upstream from the center of the cylinder and 12 D downstream from the center of the cylinder respectively. The top and bottom boundaries are situated at a distance of 4 D from the center of the cylinder.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/05/74-768x401.png"></div>

The inlet velocity was assumed to be uniform with a prescribed nonzero value of <span class="tex-text">\(u_{1}\)</span> and a zero value for the <span class="tex-text">\( u_{2}\)</span> velocity components. On both the bottom and top sides, the normal velocity component, <span class="tex-text">\( u_{2}\)</span>, was assumed to be equal to zero and <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> was not prescribed. On the cylinder surface, the no-slip condition of zero velocity components was applied. At the exit, the pressure value was assumed to be constant. In this study, a zero value for pressure was assumed at the exit. The inlet Reynolds number was defined based on the free stream inlet velocity and the diameter D of the cylinder A three-dimensional mesh was used in the vortex shedding calculations. For three dimensional flow calculations, two additional boundary conditions are necessary on the two additional surfaces at the front and back (see Figure 7.33). The two additional surfaces were assumed to have no flow in the direction normal to the surfaces. Since the two-dimensional problem was solved in three dimensions, by introducing a third dimension, the width of the domain in the third dimension is arbitrary. The smaller the size of the domain in the third dimension, then the smaller will be the number of elements in the mesh. For the three-dimensional computations carried out here the length in the third dimension was assumed to be equal to 0.5 D.The three-dimensional surface mesh is shown in Figure 7.33(a). The volume mesh used within the domain was generated using linear tetrahedral elements. A total number of approximately 600000 elements were used in the calculations. As may be observed, the mesh is very fine behind the cylinder, along the expected von Karman vortex street. This is essential in order to accurately predict the flow. A mesh convergence study in three dimensions is time-consuming and difficult, and it is advisable to analyze many meshes in order to prove the convergence of the results. Alternatively, if the problem has existing benchmark results then a comparison with these will give confidence in the results generated. Here we chose the alternative approach and compare our results with the existing data.The calculation was carried out using the artificial compressibility form of the CBS scheme (Nithiarasu 2003). The initial values of <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( u_{2}\)</span> were assumed to be equal to unity and zero respectively. Note that these values are nondimensional. All the velocity values are nondimensionalised using the reference inlet velocity value (see Section 7.3 for details). Similarly, the distances are scaled with respect to the diameter of the cylinder. These scalings result in a nondimensional inlet velocity value of unity and a cylinder diameter of unity in the nondimen- sional space. The initial values of pressure were assumed to be zero everywhere in the domain. Asmentioned previously, the solution to this problem is known to be periodic with respect to time. Once the solution reaches a steady periodic state, the periodic vortex shedding continues indefinitely. This process consists of vortex formation behind the cylinder and shedding. In Figure 7.33(b), we only show a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the <span class="tex-text">\( u _{1}\)</span> velocity distribution at a certain nondimensional time. Several such &#8220;snapshots&#8221; can be plotted but for the sake of brevity only one sample solution is given. We, however, provide the distribution of <span class="tex-text">\( u_{1}\)</span> with respect to time at an exit point of the domain in Figure 7.34 . The exit point is selected at the domain horizontal center line on the exit plane. As anticipated, the velocity at the selected exit point undergoes a steady periodic change with respect to time after establishing a steady periodic pattern. The initial period of the solution process (up to a nondimensional time of about 20 is marked with no sign of any periodic behavior of the velocity at the exit. The periodic behavior starts between nondimensional times of 20 and 30 and establishes a steady periodic pattern between the nondimensional time of 40 and 50 . The peak values remain the same after establishing a steady pattern. The initial flow pattern depends heavily on the initial values of the variables, time steps and mesh used. However, once a steady periodic pattern is established the results should agree with other solutions as shown in Figure 7.34 . The solution used in the comparison was generated from an adaptive analysis in two dimensions by de Sampaio et al. (de Sampaio et al. 1993). We also show the drag and lift co-efficient distribution with time in Figure 7.35. As seen, both conservation and nonconservation form of equations produce periodic patterns, though the results differ slightly between the two formulations (Nithiarasu and Zienkiewicz 2006)</p>
