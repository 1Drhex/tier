Her parents are interested to help her start on graduation an electronics repair business in her hometown. Their research shows that she will need then a start-up capital of $50,000. They plan to save $300 per month, beginning next month, which will at the end of 4 years be used as down payment for the bank loan she will need to set up the business.

<span class="fontstyle0">The question does not ask specifically for the cashflow table. We have two choices: (a) prepare the cashflow table as an aid to the development of cashflow diagram, or (b) do not prepare the table, and proceed directly to draw the diagram. What determines the choice? Primarily, it is the level of confidence the engineering economist has for (b). Experienced economists choose (b), bypassing the table. The decision also depends, to a large extent, on the complexity of the problem as perceived by the economist.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">This example problem does not seem too complex; let us attempt to sketch the diagram without preparing the cashflow table. We follow the four-step procedure outlined<br /> in Subsection 2.2.1.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">First, the comprehension of the problem statement. Read the problem once again (more if you need to). Monica will need $50,000 as a start-up capital on graduation 4 years from now. Her parents’ monthly savings at maturity will be used as a down payment toward the bank loan. If the savings accumulate to F, then the loan will only be (50,000 – F). Also recall that her parents withdraw the interest earned by their savings. In other words, only the monthly savings of $300 accumulate. Since the savings are monthly over 4 years, there are 4 </span><span class="fontstyle2">× </span><span class="fontstyle0">12 = 48 time periods.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">With this comprehension, we are ready to draw the cashflow diagram. Let us go through the four steps; keep glancing at Fig. 2.4 as you read :</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 1: <span class="tex-text">\(Timeline\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Set out a horizontal line of reasonable length, say 5 inches.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 2: <span class="tex-text">\(Time Markers\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Beginning at the left end, mark equal lengths (an inch) on this line to represent the early time periods (months). Since the number of periods is large (forty-eight), they all cannot be shown; so, show discontinuation using dotted lines and mark the last two time periods (see Fig. 2.4). Write down the time periods at the markers, beginning with 0 at the left end and ending with 48 at the right end.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 3: <span class="tex-text">\(Cashflow Scale\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">All cashflows in this problem are the same ($300). We can choose any reasonable vector length, since no further scaling is required. Let us say 1 inch represents the cashflow amount $300.</span></p>
 <h5><span class="fontstyle0">Step 4: <span class="tex-text">\(Draw the Vectors\)</span></span></h5> <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">Now, sketch the arrowed cashflow vectors. As per the problem statement, there is no cashflow now, i.e., at marker 0. The cashflow begins at period 1, where we draw a 1-<span class="tex-text">\(inch^{2}\)</span> </span><span class="fontstyle0"> </span><span class="fontstyle0">vector to show the saving of the first month. But, which way? Up or down?</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">The answer lies in determining whether the cashflow is negative or positive. For Monica’s parents, the savings are outflows (costs), so the vector should be downward, below the timeline. A smart way to determine whether the vector should be downward or upward is to remember this: If the cashflow brings the account balance <span class="tex-text">\(down\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">, the vector should be <span class="tex-text">\(downward\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">; if it makes the balance go <span class="tex-text">\(up\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">, the vector should be <span class="tex-text">\(upward\)</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">. In this case, because the cashflow brings down Monica’s parents’ account balance, the vector is downward. At the other markers we similarly sketch 1-inch downward vectors.</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="fontstyle0">In problems where the timeline has to be long to accommodate all the time periods, as in the previous example, it is shown broken—a common engineering practice to show continuity. Also, some of the cashflows may be disproportionately large in comparison to the others. Again, the taller cashflow vectors may be shown broken. Fig. 2.5 shows a cashflow diagram in which both the timeline and the tallest vector (5,000 at period 0) are shown broken. Breaks having similar meaning are commonly practiced in engineering drawings. Even when the timeline has a break, its two ends should be shown complete with appropriate point markers. For the vector too, the break should be in the middle rather than at the ends. Another enhancement to a cashflow diagram may be the absence of the currency symbol to add visual clarity, as in Fig. 2.5.</span></p>
