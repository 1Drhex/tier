            <p class="blog">As Marvin (see previous case studies) entered the second year of his business, things<br /> appeared to be going well. His fame was spreading and he was invited to appear on<br /> 1 July 2012 at the prestigious Gala Stars Show. As the highlight of his act was the ‘disappearing<br /> lady’ trick, he was highly embarrassed when, after saying the ‘magic words’ and<br /> tapping the correct number of times with his wand, the curtains drew back to reveal<br /> Esmeralda in a close embrace with a stagehand. Marvin was so furious that as soon as<br /> the show was over he not only sacked Esmeralda but also closed his magic set factory<br /> (thereby putting Esmeralda’s seven brothers and sisters, the factory’s only employees,<br /> out of work). Immediately, all the factory’s inventory was sold at cost and the factory<br /> machinery was sold at its depreciated value.<br /> During the six months to 31 December 2012, the following events occurred:</p> <p class="blog"><strong>1</strong> The disappearing lady apparatus was sold on 1 August 2012 for £1,000. Its depreciated<br /> value at 30 June 2012 was £1,200 (cost £2,000 less 40% p.a. diminishing balance<br /> depreciation). A further one month’s depreciation is to be charged prior to calculating the<br /> profit or loss on disposal.<br /> <strong>2</strong> Marvin took on a new assistant, Chiquita, who was previously employed as a receivables<br /> ledger clerk at Kaboosh Limited. She was to perform in a new ‘saw the lady in<br /> half ’ routine (for which a new prop costing £3,000 was bought on 1 September 2012)<br /> as well as supervising the collection of Marvin’s trade receivables. She immediately prepared<br /> a report on the Receivables Ledger, showing that at 31 August 2012 he was owed<br /> £900, including £200 from Tanya Turner who was a ‘bad’ debtor, and £150 from Carlos<br /> Gonzales whose cheque had been returned by his bank three times marked ‘no funds<br /> available’ and was to be considered doubtful.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong><br /> (a) Calculate the profit or loss on disposal of the ‘disappearing lady’ apparatus.<br /> (b) Explain the effect on Marvin’s profit and assets of classifying debts as ‘bad’ or<br /> ‘doubtful’.</p>

(b) The £200 bad debt will be written off to the income statement, thus reducing operating<br /> profit. Trade receivables (current assets) also decrease by £200.<br /> Doubtful debts do not affect the receivables ledger as the account is kept alive as<br /> long as there is a glimmer of hope of payment. However profits are set aside from<br /> the income statement to ensure that all the doubtful debts are covered by a provision.<br /> The total provision is then deducted from the total trade receivables (after<br /> any bad debts have been deleted). The effect on profits depends on whether the<br /> provision is being created, increased or decreased:</p>
 <p class="blog">
• Created: the full amount of the provision comes out of profit (shown as part of<br /> ‘expenses’).<br /> • Increased: only the extra amount needed comes out of profit (shown as part of<br /> ‘expenses’).<br /> • Decreased: the surplus provision is added back to increase the profit.</p>
