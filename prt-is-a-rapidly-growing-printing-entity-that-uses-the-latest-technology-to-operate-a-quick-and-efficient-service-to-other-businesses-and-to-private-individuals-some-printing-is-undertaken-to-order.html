            <p class="blog">PRT is a rapidly growing printing entity that uses the latest technology to operate a quick and efficient service to other businesses and to private individuals. Some printing is undertaken to order, while other work, such as posters, is held in inventory until sold. Sales to business customers are on credit, while sales to individuals are for cash.</p> <p class="blog">Expansion has been rapid, as indicated by the number of print shops owned at each financial year ended 31 March:<br /> Year 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002<br /> Number of print shops 8 12 18 27 40<br /> While expansion has been very rapid, concerns have arisen regarding the increasing overdraft, which is now approaching the limit of $1 million set by the bank. The entity has used equity and debt finance to expand in recent years, but is unlikely to be able to raise further finance from these sources in the immediate future.<br /> Extracts from the financial statements for the years ended 31 March are as follows:</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  width="217"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="89"></td> <td width="64">2001</td> <td width="64">2002</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>$000</td> <td>$000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Raw material inventory</td> <td>55</td> <td>80</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Finished goods inventory</td> <td>185</td> <td>185</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Purchases of raw materials</td> <td>600</td> <td>850</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cost of sales</td> <td>1.57</td> <td>1,830</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Administrative expenses</td> <td>45</td> <td>65</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sales</td> <td>1.684</td> <td>1,996</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Trade receivables</td> <td>114</td> <td>200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Trade payables</td> <td>50</td> <td>70</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Overdraft</td> <td>400</td> <td>950</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Additions to non-current assets</td> <td>700</td> <td>900</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">Cost of sales includes all relevant production costs including manufacturing overheads and labour.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Calculate the length in days of PRT’s working capital cycle, for the year ended 31 March 2002.<br /> (b) So far as the information permits, calculate the cash generated from operating activities for PRT for the year ended 31 March 2002. State any relevant assumptions.<br /> (c) As PRT’s management accountant, write a memorandum to the board that analyses the entity’s cash and working capital position, recommending appropriate actions.

(c)<br /> Memorandum<br /> To: The Board of PRT From: Management Accountant<br /> Subject : Cash Management Date: 21 May 2002<br /> Introduction<br /> The entity appears to be suffering from over-trading as indicated by the number of outlets growing at 50% a year. These appear to be purchased, hence this would be a major drain on cash resources.<br /> To the extent that this expansion could be financed by new equity and new debt, it is not a major problem. It would appear, however, that more recently an overdraft has been used to finance some of the expansion. This appears to be particularly unwise as it is financing a long-term asset with a short-term liability.<br /> In particular, if no new finance can be raised, then the bank could force the entity into liquidation by calling-in the overdraft at any time. This may occur notwithstanding the actual, and potential, profitability of the business.<br /> Cash management<br /> The most important feature of cash management would therefore appear to be maintaining a good relationship with the bank. This could include:<br /> ● supplying monthly management accounts;<br /> ● informing the bank of any problems in advance, that is before they affect the management accounts;<br /> ● provision of additional security if possible – either entity assets or directors’ personal assets.<br /> Notwithstanding efforts to maintain the bank’s goodwill, it is necessary to reduce the overdraft or at least prevent it increasing. If this does not occur, the overdraft is almost certain to be called-in. The most obvious remaining sources of finance (given debt and equity capital appear to be exhausted) are:<br /> ● capital assets;<br /> ● operating activities;<br /> ● improved working capital management.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Current ratios<br /> Current ratios provide a summary measure of working capital. These are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
2001</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{55+185+114}{50+400} = 0.787:1 \)</span> <p class="blog">
2002</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{80+185+200}{70+950} = 0.456:1 \)</span> <p class="blog">
The deterioration in the current ratio reflects the increase in the overdraft. The ratio is, however, a static representation at a point in time. The primary concern is whether future cash inflows are sufficient to meet the future cash outflows necessary to sustain and expand the business.<br /> Capital assets<br /> The cause of the cash management problems appears to be over- nvestment in new outlets.<br /> No further outlets should therefore be opened. Cash can, however, be raised from existing outlets given that they appear to be owned by the entity.<br /> Outlets could be sold. Unfortunately, sales of property may take some time unless the price is reduced significantly. This is likely to generate a significant loss. This is even more true of plant, machinery and fixtures, which are likely to have a low net realisable value.<br /> Rather than buying the outlets, significant cash savings could have been made by leasing them. While the purchase decision is in the past, cash can still be recovered using a sale and leaseback arrangement – perhaps with the entity’s bankers.<br /> Operating cash flows<br /> While the number of outlets has risen by 50% a year, sales have increased by only 18.5% in the last year. There may be a number of reasons for this:<br /> ● sales have not yet become established at new outlets;<br /> ● price cutting has taken place to penetrate new markets so sales volume growth has not been matched by sales value growth;<br /> ● the size of later outlets could be smaller than earlier outlets.<br /> Whatever the reason, the cash flow generated from operations is small at $10,000 in the current year (see (b)). As a result, either substantial growth in operating cash flows is needed or realisation of capital assets by sale or lease.<br /> Working capital management<br /> Improved working capital management may generate extra funds, but it is unlikely to be sufficient on its own.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The raw materials cycle appears reasonable at 29 days, but some materials are purchased for immediate use on made-to-order jobs. This means that the holding period on the remaining inventory may be significant. More information is therefore needed on the holding period for individual inventory lines. Similarly, some of the sales are in respect of made-to-order jobs, thus the finished goods inventorys relating to the remaining sales may be disproportionately high. The trade receivables cycle appears reasonable at 29 days, but this is an average, and given that<br /> sales to private customers are for cash, it means that the credit period extended to business customers is rather longer than 29 days. Improvements to cash flow from trade receivables management may include:<br /> ● factoring of debts may produce increased cash, but may be costly;<br /> ● similarly, the credit terms offered by the entity could be managed via an outside finance entity;<br /> ● discounts for cash settlement or reduced credit terms may be offered.<br /> The payables cycle at 26 days seems rather short and it might be worth investigating the possibility of suppliers extending further credit. If cash discounts are taken, this may explain the short cycle, but they may be worth forgoing in the short term to help liquidity. As with all ratios, care needs to be taken as the balance sheet figure may be atypical because of:<br /> ● growth;<br /> ● seasonality;<br /> ● large sales/purchases just before the year end;<br /> ● manipulation.<br /> Conclusion<br /> The need for cash is urgent. While operating activities and improved working capital management may provide some help, a more significant immediate injection of cash may be needed to maintain the goodwill and co-operation of the bank. In this context, the sale or the sale and leaseback of non-current assets may be the most appropriate policy.<br /> Information in respect of these possibilities is therefore urgently needed.<br /> Signed: Management Accountant.</p>
