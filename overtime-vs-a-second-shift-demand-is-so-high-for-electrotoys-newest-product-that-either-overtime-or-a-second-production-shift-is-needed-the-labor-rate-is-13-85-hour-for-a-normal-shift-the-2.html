            <p class="blog">Overtime vs. a Second Shift</p> <p class="blog">Demand is so high for ElectroToy’s newest product that either overtime or a second production shift is needed. The labor rate is $13.85/hour for a normal shift. There is a 50% premium for overtime and a 10% shift differential. Productivity is 5% lower for overtime, and there is a 4-hour minimum for a second shift. Sick leave, retirement, vacation, and insurance benefits add 19% to the direct hourly cost.</p> <p class="blog">For this product, 60 units per hour are produced on the first shift. Each unit has $1.25 in material and $4.50 in purchased parts. The indirect cost for each is $2.12 for other assembly line costs. The firm’s administrative, sales, and managerial costs are charged at 35% of total labor cost.</p> <p class="blog">Mario has been asked to recommend the most cost-effective way to produce an extra 120 units per week beyond the 480 produced on the regular shift. Based on his experience and talking with others, he concludes the following:</p> <p class="blog">1. The cost for the first 480 and the average cost of the 600 per week are irrelevant. What matters is the marginal cost for another unit.<br /> 2. The direct labor cost for each unit produced on the second shift will be 30.2¢ (= $13.85 × 1.1 × 1.19/60). This includes the shift differential and the cost for employee benefits.<br /> 3. The lower productivity of overtime hours decreases output to 57 per hour (= 60 × .95). Thus, producing 60 takes 1.053 hours, which is the inverse of .95. Thus, the direct labor cost for overtime units is 43.4¢ (= $13.85 × 1.5 × 1.19 × 1.053/60).<br /> 4. The $5.75 (= $1.25 + $4.50) in material and purchased-parts cost can be ignored, since it is the same for both alternatives.<br /> 5. The indirect assembly line costs are determined by how long the assembly line runs. Thus, the unit cost is $2.12 for the second shift and $2.232 (= $2.12/.95) for overtime.<br /> 6. The overhead costs of 35% can be ignored. These costs are allocated based on labor costs, but they will not change between alternatives.</p> <p class="blog">Based on this analysis, Mario concludes that the second shift will save a marginal cost of 29.6¢ per unit (= 43.4¢ + $2.232 &#8211; 30.2¢ &#8211; $2.12). Thus, he recommends using a second shift.<br /> Is this conclusion correct?</p>

Mario’s analysis has one error and two weaknesses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. The error is that he did not allow for the second shift’s minimum length of 4 hours. This introduces a fixed cost for the incremental 120 units. Because of this, Mario should have computed the cost for the incremental 120 units. See below.<br /> 2. It is likely that some of the benefit costs (19%) do not increase with overtime. For example, vacation time usually accrues at a fixed number of weeks (2 or 3) per year. Similarly, most insurance and sick benefits are fixed per year. If retirement benefits are based on annual pay, then overtime would increase the firm’s cost. Mario’s firm matches retirement contributions up to a maximum of 8%.<br /> 3. Hiring individuals for a second shift will increase administrative and managerial expenses. The detailed computation must include the cost for advertising, interviews, initial training, and time to reach full productivity. If the second shift is temporary, then shutdown or termination costs must be included. These costs are estimated at 25% of total labor costs.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The correct incremental cost for overtime includes the 50% premium, the lower productivity, and the 8% increase in retirement expenses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( cost_{overtime}\)</span> = 120 [$13.85/60 × 1.5 × 1.08 × 1.053 + $2.232] = $315.09 or $2.63/unit</p>
 <p class="blog">
For the second shift, the incremental cost is for 4 hours of labor and the indirect costs of the assembly line. This includes the 10% shift premium, the 19% benefit expense, and the 25% increase in administrative and managerial expenses.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(cost_{2nd shift}\)</span> = 4 × $13.85 × 1.1 × 1.19 × 1.25 + 120 × $2.12 = $345.05 or $2.88/unit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus, for shifts of about 2 hours, overtime is cheaper. However, the second shift will be more cost effective as the 4-hour minimum is approached. Note that longer overtime shifts reduce productivity by more than 5%.</p>
