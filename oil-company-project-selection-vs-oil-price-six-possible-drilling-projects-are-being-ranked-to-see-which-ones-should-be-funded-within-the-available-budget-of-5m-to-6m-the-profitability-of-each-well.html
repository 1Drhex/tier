            <p class="blog">Oil Company Project Selection vs. Oil Price<br /> Six possible drilling projects are being ranked to see which ones should be funded within the available budget of $5M to $6M. The profitability of each well is determined by its first cost (in $M), the number of years it will last, its annualized rate of production (in barrels, or bbl), the variable cost of production and transportation from that well (in dollars per barrel), and the average selling price of oil over the well’s life (in dollars per barrel).Assume a base case average oil price of $20 per barrel, with lower and upper limits of ±25%Analyze the sensitivity diagram with respect to the price of oil to see which drilling projects are the most attractive for low, base case, and high oil prices.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 237px;" width="535"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="75">Project</td> <td width="81">First (in $M)</td> <td width="72">Life (years)</td> <td width="109">Production Cost ($/bbl)</td> <td width="113">Annualized Volume (bbl)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>A</td> <td>$2</td> <td>20</td> <td>$9</td> <td>60,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>B</td> <td>1</td> <td>10</td> <td>14</td> <td>40,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>C</td> <td>1.5</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>40,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>D</td> <td>2.1</td> <td>25</td> <td>10</td> <td>50,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>E</td> <td>1.6</td> <td>16</td> <td>9</td> <td>20,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>F</td> <td>2</td> <td>20</td> <td>5</td> <td>20,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

Note that this is a spiderplot, in which each of the six projects has only one curve to its spider.<br /> The basic equation for each project is:<br /> 0 = FirstCost + Volume × (OilPrice – ProdCost) × (P/A, i, Life)<br /> Rewriting this as a spreadsheet function for each project’s IRR, the result in Excel is:<br /> RATE(Life, Volume * (OilPrice – ProdCost), –FirstCost)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Then, a table of IRR values for each project at each of the three oil prices is constructed to support the graph. Exhibit 17.20 graphs the central part of the sensitivity plot (very low and very high internal rates of return are not graphed). In general, those projects with higher production costs are more sensitive to the price of oil.<br /> Project A is the most attractive in all three cases, and it should be funded. Project C is ranked second in the base case and third with the upper limit of oil prices, and it is tied for third/fourth with the lower limit of oil prices. These together cost $3.5M.<br /> In the base case and with the lower limit, project D is ranked third and second, respectively.<br /> Project B is ranked fourth for the base case and second with oil prices at the upper limit. Since project B is ranked last and has a very negative IRR if average prices fall to the lower limit, project D appears to be a better choice. The total recommended budget is $5.6M for projects A, C, and D.<br /> Unfortunately, the decision to fund these projects must be made with current information. It is not possible to be certain about average oil prices over the next 25 years.</p>
