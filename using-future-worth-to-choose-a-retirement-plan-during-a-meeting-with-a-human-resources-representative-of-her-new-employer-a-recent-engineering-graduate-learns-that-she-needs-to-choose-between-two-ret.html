            <p class="blog"><strong>Using Future Worth to Choose a Retirement Plan</strong><br /> During a meeting with a human resources representative of her new employer, a recent engineering graduate learns that she needs to choose between two retirement plans. One plan involves investments that are matched by the employer; the plan is managed by a committee of employees in the firm. Another option is to establish an investment plan that she will manage. In both cases, deposits are tax-deferred; also in both cases, withdrawal of funds before age 62 will result in a significant financial penalty. Her current age is 22.<br /> Under the first plan, up to 4 percent of an employee’s annual compensation is matched by the employer. Funds are invested in a mix of securities, including the company’s own stock; however, no more than 20 percent of the investment portfolio is allowed to be invested in the firm’s stock. The portfolio includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and U.S. Treasury notes. Over the past 15 years, the investment portfolio has increased in value at an annual compound rate of 6 percent.</p> <p class="blog">Under the second plan, individuals can manage their own investment portfolios. Although there are limits on the investments that can be made, a number of riskier choices are available. Individuals who choose to manage their own portfolio have to pay a management fee of 1.5 percent of their annual deposit. The company still matches up to 4 percent of the employee’s annual compensation.<br /> After considering the investments available in the second plan, the new employee narrows the choices to a set of investments that historically have earned between 2 and 12 percent annually.<br /> If the employee’s current salary is $55,000, she invests the maximum allowed, and her annual salary increases at an annual rate of 5 percent, which retirement plan should she choose?<br /> KEY DATA <strong>Given</strong>: The employee and plan details summarized below.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table > <tbody> <tr> <td width="355">First Plan</td> <td width="355">Second Plan</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">4% of annual salary invested + 4% company match</td> <td width="355">4% of annual salary invested + 4% company match</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">Current annual salary = $55,000</td> <td width="355">Current annual salary = $55,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">Annual salary increase = 5%</td> <td width="355">Annual salary increase = 5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">Historical portfolio annual growth = 6%</td> <td width="355">Historical portfolio annual growth =</p> <p class="blog">2% to 12%</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="355">No management fees</td> <td width="355">Annual management fee = 1.5%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

What would you have done? Given the impact on investment returns of the global economic collapse of 2008, how reasonable are the annual increases in salary and the annual returns on her investment over a 40-year period?</p>
