The numbers on the arcs are miles. Arcs with double-headed arrows indicate that travel is possible in both directions (with the same distance in both directions). What route should Maude take?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong> To specialize the general network flow model so that a shortest path from node 1 to node 10 can be found.<br /> <strong>Where Do the Numbers Come From?</strong><br /> The distances on the arcs are presumably listed on state maps for the roads Maude is considering. Note, however, that in shortest path problems such as this, the objective is sometimes total cost, not distance. Although the cost of an arc might be proportional to its distance, it might not be. For example, a steep uphill route might be more “costly” than a flat stretch of similar length. In such cases, the arc costs would be somewhat more difficult to obtain.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/09/5.27-2.png"></div>

The variables and constraints for this model are shown in Figure 5.28. (See the file Shortest Path Big Picture.xlsx.) This network model is exactly like the general logistics model in the previous section. All you need to specify is that node 1 has a supply of 1 (you can think of it as Maude herself), node 10 has a demand of 1, and all other nodes are transshipment nodes.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed model appears in Figure 5.29. (See the file Shortest Path Finished.xlsx.) Because this is so similar to the general logistics model, most of the details are omitted, and the Solver dialog box is not shown. However, the following points are important.<br /> 1) Arc list. There is an arc listed in columns A and B for each arc in the graphical network. If the arc goes in both directions, it is listed twice (2 to 4 and 4 to 2, for example).<br /> 2) Net outflows. All types of nodes are listed in a single block in the flow balance constraint section. Node 1 is an origin with a supply of 1, and it has only outflows. Similarly, node 10 is a destination with demand 1, and it has only inflows. The intermediate nodes are all transshipment nodes. You can treat all of the nodes similarly by calculating the net outflow from each. To do so, enter the formula .<br /> =SUMIF(Origin,F5,Flow)-SUMIF(Destination,F5,Flow)<br /> in cell G5 and copy it down for the other nodes. For node 1, this net outflow is really just the outflow, so it should be 1. For node 10, this net outflow is really just the negative of the inflow, so it should be –1. For all intermediate nodes, the net outflow should be 0. This explains the values in column I.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3 Total distance. The objective to minimize is total distance, calculated in cell B42 with the formula<br /> =SUMPRODUCT(Distance,Flow)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Discussion of the Solution</strong><br /> After Solver finds the optimal flows, which are 0’s and 1’s, it is easy to identify the shortest path—just follow the 1’s. According to Figure 5.29, Maude first goes from node 1 to node 4 (row 7), then she goes from node 4 to node 6 (row 20), and finally she goes from node 6 to node 10 (row 31). Using this route from 1 to 10, Maude must walk 198 miles, the sum of the distances on the three arcs she traverses.<br /> Make sure you understand exactly how this model works. There are really two parts: the total distance and the balance of inflows and outflows. For any solution of 0’s and 1’s in the Flow column, the SUMPRODUCT for total distance sums the distances in column C corresponding to the arcs traversed. This accurately reflects the total distance Maude walks.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For flow balance, consider any intermediate node. If Maude’s route goes through it, such as with node 6, the two SUMIF functions in column G for this node both evaluate to 1—that is, one of the arcs leading into node 6 has a flow of 1, and one of the arcs leading out of node 6 has a flow of 1. On the other hand, if Maude’s route doesn’t go through the node, such as with node 3, the two SUMIF functions for this node both evaluate to 0—no flow in and no flow out. Finally, the flow balance constraints for nodes 1 and 10 ensure that exactly one arc leading out of node 1 has a flow of 1, and exactly one arc leading into node 10 has a flow of 1.</p>
