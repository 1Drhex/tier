The Finance Director is concerned about the cash flow forecast for the first six months and has asked you, a trainee management accountant, to prepare a cash budget for the six months from January to June 2006 from the budgeted information provided.<br /> Budgeted revenue<br /> Short training courses<br /> Short training courses budgeted charge $100 per person per course. Short courses are generally one night a week for four weeks commencing on the first of each month, except December and January.</p> <p class="blog">Budgeted short course information: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul<br /> Number of courses 0 2 3 3 4 4 4<br /> Forecast students per course 0 10 12 12 14 13 15</p> <p class="blog">BB expects to receive payment in advance of each course. Experience shows that, on average, one-third of students pay one month in advance and the rest pay on the first day of the course.<br /> In-house training courses<br /> The exact number and type of in-house training courses is unknown at present but, during 2006, BB is expecting to earn $130,000 spread evenly throughout the year. Based on previous experience, the following receipts are forecast:<br /> . Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun<br /> In-house training course fee receipts $5,000 $8,000 $10,000 $11,000 $12,000 $6,000<br /> (including trade receivables at 31 December 2005)<br /> BB has previously experienced problems of slow payment from some large employers and is monitoring the trade receivables collection period.<br /> Budgeted expenditure<br /> BB employs permanent full-time members of staff to run the entity and provide key lecturing skills. Most of the trainers are part-time tutors at an hourly rate.<br /> Budgeted wages 2006 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun<br /> Part-time tutor wages $0 $2,500 $4,000 $4,000 $5,000 $6,000</p> <p class="blog">Permanent staff salaries are currently $4,000 a month. All full-time staff will receive an increase of 5% from 1 March 2006.<br /> BB rents the premises for $2,500 a year, payable in quarterly instalments in January, April, July and October.<br /> Teaching materials, printing and photocopying average $150 per short course (paid in the month of the course). The in-house courses cost, on average, $100 per month.<br /> Budgeted payments in respect of overheads (electricity, telephone and so on) for January and April are $1,500 and for February, March, May and June are $600.<br /> Capital expenditure in the first six months of 2006 is planned as follows:<br /> (i) New furniture for the managing director’s office $5,000 payable in April.<br /> (ii) BB needs to replace all the IT equipment in one of its computer labs early in 2006. This is currently planned to take place in April, with payment in May 2006. The budgeted cost of the equipment is $40,000 for 20 top-of-the-range PCs and related equipment.<br /> Other information<br /> BB has negotiated an overdraft facility with the bank for an overdraft up to $5,000.<br /> Requirements<br /> (a) Calculate BB’s in-house training course trade receivables days outstanding<br /> (i) according to the forecast at 31 December 2005;<br /> (ii) according to the projected figures at 30 June 2006, assuming the revenue and cash flow budgets are implemented.<br /> (b) Prepare BB’s cash budget for the first six months of 2006 (January to June).<br /> (c) Advise BB of any actions it can take to make sufficient funds available to purchase the new technology as budgeted in May 2006.</p>

 <p class="blog">
(b) The cash flow forecast currently shows that there is likely to be an overdraft of nearly $15,000 if all the capital expenditure takes place as planned. If the bank overdraft facility is utilised, there is still a shortfall of $10,000.<br /> Actions that could be taken to increase the amount to provide sufficient funds to purchase the new technology as budgeted could involve either raising new cash or re-examining the forecast and implementing actions to improve the current forecast. It must also be borne in mind that sufficient working capital needs to be available to run BB after the new equipment has been purchased.<br /> Actions could include:<br /> (i) Considering delaying or cancelling the purchase of the MD’s furniture will release $5,000.<br /> (ii) Arranging a long-term loan with a bank, or other financial institution, for $20,000, to provide additional working capital.<br /> (iii) Issuing new equity to cover the non-current asset purchase and provide additional working capital, a minimum of $20,000.<br /> (iv) Negotiating an increase in the overdraft facility from $5,000 to $20,000.<br /> (v) Considering increasing course fees to generate more income.<br /> (vi) Investigating the possibility of acquiring the IT equipment and furniture by hire purchase or lease.<br /> (vii) Examining the in-house training courses debt collection procedures and implement action to speed up revenue collection. If the trade receivable days can be reduced from the projected 132, to say, 90 days, an extra one-off receipt of $15,000 would accrue in the period.<br /> (viii) Checking the accuracy of the forecast opening bank balance and the likelihood of it being significantly different to forecast.<br /> (ix) Considering enforcing the requirement for all short course participants to pay in advance of the course instead of allowing payment on the first day of the course.</p>
