The resultant magnetic field <span class="tex-text">\( B^ \prime \)</span> is the sum of the magnetic fields of the Earth and the coil, <span class="tex-text">\( B_0 \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( B \)</span> respectively, i.e.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( B^\prime = B_0±B. \)</span> (1)</p>
 <p class="blog">
The current flowing through the coil is determined by the induced voltage <span class="tex-text">\( V_i \)</span> and the resistance <span class="tex-text">\( R,\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( I = \frac{V_i}{R} = B^ \prime \frac{r^2 w}{2} \frac{1}{R}, \)</span> (2)</p>
 <p class="blog">
where the induced voltage has been calculated from the rate at which a disc radius cuts the field&#8217;s magnetic flux. The magnetic field produced by the coil itself is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( B= μ_0n I . \)</span> (3)</p>
 <p class="blog">
From the three equations above, <span class="tex-text">\( B, \ B^\prime \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( I \)</span> can easily be determined. The two signs occurring in equation (1) allow for both positive and negative values of the angular frequency. The value of <span class="tex-text">\( w \)</span> is taken to be positive if the magnetic field of the coil acts in the same direction as that of the Earth. The following results are obtained for the resultant magnetic field and the current:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( B^\prime = \frac{2R B_0}{2R &#8211; \mu _0 n r^2 w} \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( I = \frac{ B_0 r^2 w}{2R &#8211; \mu _0 n r^2 w}. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
As expected, when the disc is at rest, the current is zero and the resultant magnetic field inside the coil is simply <span class="tex-text">\( B_0, \)</span> the magnetic field of the Earth.</p>
 <p class="blog">
When the direction of rotation is such that the field in the coil opposes the external magnetic field <span class="tex-text">\( (w &lt; 0) \)</span> the resultant decreases asymptotically to zero as the (negative) angular frequency of the disc increases. At such high rotation speeds, the current flowing in the coil tends to <span class="tex-text">\(-B_0/ μ_0 n \)</span> (the value needed to cancel the magnetic field of the Earth).</p>
 <p class="blog">
Rotation of the disc in the opposite direction, <span class="tex-text">\( (w &gt; 0), \)</span> causes the resultant magnetic field to increase. This leads to a higher voltage being induced and a larger current flowing, which in turn leads to a further increase in the magnetic field. Under these positive feedback conditions, both the magnetic field and the current tend to infinity as a particular &#8216;critical&#8217; angular frequency, <span class="tex-text">\( w_{crit} = 2R/(μ_0 nr^2), \)</span> is approached, as shown in Fig. S181.1. Such a state is obviously not realised in practice. If the angular frequency is increased too much, the current and the heat given out by the coil increase until the wires burn away!</p>
 <p class="blog">
The strange behaviour of the system can be more easily understood if the relationship between the current in the coil and the resultant magnetic field is represented graphically as in Fig. S181.2. According to equation (2), <span class="tex-text">\( I \)</span> is proportional to <span class="tex-text">\( B^ \prime \)</span> in such a way that the coefficient of proportionality depends on <span class="tex-text">\( w.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This is represented by a straight line through the origin, with a gradient proportional to <span class="tex-text">\( w. \)</span> Equations (1) and (3) show that <span class="tex-text">\( B^ \prime = B_0 + μ_0 nI \)</span> ; this is also a linear relationship, but its graph does not pass through the origin.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The gradient of the latter is <span class="tex-text">\( 1/(μ_0 n) \)</span> and independent of <span class="tex-text">\( w.\)</span> The intersection of these two straight lines determines the actual current and the resultant magnetic field. If <span class="tex-text">\( w = w_{crit} , \)</span> then the gradients of the two straight lines are the same and the equations have no solution. In fact, the critical angular frequency is so high that the corresponding state cannot even be approached in practice.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Joule heat given out by the coil has to be equal to the mechanical work done in rotating the disc. The electrical power is <span class="tex-text">\( P_{el} = I^ 2 R, \)</span> while the mechanical work done per second is the product of the torque and the angular frequency, <span class="tex-text">\( P_{mech} = Mw = B^ \prime Ir^2w/2. \)</span> (The torque <span class="tex-text">\( M \)</span> has been calculated as the product of the force <span class="tex-text">\( B^ \prime Ir \)</span> and the average perpendicular distance of its line of action from the axis, <span class="tex-text">\( r /2.\)</span> ) Using the relationship between <span class="tex-text">\( B^\prime \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( I,\)</span> it can be verified directly that <span class="tex-text">\( P_{el} = P_{mech}·\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The strange device described in this problem is called a <em>unipolar dynamo</em>.</p>
