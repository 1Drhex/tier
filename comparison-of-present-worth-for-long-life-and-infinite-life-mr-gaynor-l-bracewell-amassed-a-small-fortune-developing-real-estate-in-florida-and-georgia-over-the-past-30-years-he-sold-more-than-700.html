            <p class="blog"><strong>Comparison of Present Worth for Long Life and Infinite Life</strong></p> <p class="blog">Mr. Gaynor L. Bracewell amassed a small fortune developing real estate in Florida and Georgia over the past 30 years. He sold more than 700 acres of timber and farmland to raise $800,000 with which he built a small hydroelectric plant, known as High Shoals Hydro. The plant was a decade in the making. The design for Mr. Bracewell’s plant, which he developed using his Army training as a civil engineer, is relatively simple. A 22-foot-deep canal, blasted out of solid rock just above the higher of two dams on his property, carries water 1,000 feet along the river to a “trash rack” where leaves and other debris are caught. A 6-foot-wide pipeline capable of holding three million pounds of liquid then funnels the water into the powerhouse at 7.5 feet per second, thereby creating 33,000 pounds of thrust against the turbines. Under a 1978 Federal law designed to encourage alternative power sources, Georgia Power Company is required to purchase any electricity Mr. Bracewell can supply. Mr. Bracewell estimates that his plant can generate 6 million kilowatt-hours per year.</p> <p class="blog">Suppose that, after paying income taxes and operating expenses, Mr. Bracewell’s annual income from the hydroelectric plant will be $120,000. With normal maintenance, the plant is expected to provide service for at least 50 years. Figure 5.11 illustrates when and in what quantities Mr. Bracewell spent his $800,000 (not taking into account the time value of money) during the last 10 years. Was Mr. Bracewell’s $800,000 investment a wise one? How long will he have to wait to recover his initial investment, and will he ever make a profit? Examine the situation by computing the project’s worth at varying interest rates.</p> <p class="blog">(a) If Mr. Bracewell’s interest rate is 8%, compute the NPW (at time 0 in Figure 5.11) of this project with a 50-year service life and infinite service, respectively.<br /> (b) Repeat part (a), assuming an interest rate of 12%.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/06/figure-5-11-768x500.jpg"></div>

<strong>Given:</strong> Cash flow in Figure 5.11 (to 50 years or ∞) and i = 8% or 12%, respectively.<br /> <strong>Find:</strong> NPW at time 0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
One of the main questions is whether Mr. Bracewell’s plant will be profitable. Now we will compute the equivalent total investment and the equivalent worth of receiving future revenues at the start of power generation (i.e., at time 0).</p>
 <p class="blog">
(a) Let i = 8%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• With a plant service life of 50 years:</strong> We can make use of single-payment compound-amount factors in the invested cash flow to help us find the equivalent total investment at the start of power generation. Using K to indicate thousands, we obtain</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{1}\)</span> = &#8211; $50K(F/P, 8%, 9) &#8211; $50K(F/P, 8%, 8)<br /> -$60K(F/P, 8%, 7) &#8230; &#8211; $100K(F/P, 8%, 1) &#8211; $60K<br /> = &#8211; $1,101K</p>
 <p class="blog">
The equivalent total benefit at the start of generation is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{2}\)</span> = $120K(P/A, 8%, 50) = $1,468K</p>
 <p class="blog">
Summing, we find the net equivalent worth at the start of power generation:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{1}+V_{2}\)</span> = -$1,101K + $1,468K<br /> = $367K</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• With an infinite service life:</strong> The net equivalent worth is called the capitalized equivalent worth. The investment portion prior to time 0 is identical, so the capitalized equivalent worth is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">CE(8%) = &#8211; $1,101K + $120K/(0.08)<br /> = $399K</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the difference between the infinite situation and the planning horizon of 50 years is only $32,000.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) Let i = 12%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• With a service life of 50 years:</strong> Proceeding as we did in part (a), we find that the equivalent total investment at the start of power generation is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{1}\)</span> = &#8211; $50K(F/P, 12%, 9) &#8211; $50K(F/P, 12%, 8)<br /> -$60K(F/P, 12%, 7) &#8230; &#8211; $100K(F/P, 12%, 1) &#8211; $60K<br /> = &#8211; $1,299K</p>
 <p class="blog">
Equivalent total benefits at the start of power generation are</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{2}\)</span> = $120K(P/A, 12%, 50) = $997K</p>
 <p class="blog">
The net equivalent worth at the start of power generation is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(V_{1}+V_{2}\)</span> = -$1,299K + $997K<br /> = -$302K</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>• With infinite cash flows:</strong> The capitalized equivalent worth at the current time is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">CE(12%) = -$1,299K + $120K/(0.12)<br /> = -$299K</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note that the difference between the infinite situation and a planning horizon of 50 years is merely $3,000, which demonstrates that we may approximate the present worth of long cash flows (i.e., 50 years or more) by using the capitalized equivalent value. The accuracy of the approximation improves as the interest rate increases (or the number of years is greater).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Comments:</strong> At i = 12%, Mr. Bracewell’s investment is not a profitable one, but at 8%, it is. This outcome indicates the importance of using the appropriate i in investment analysis. The issue of selecting an appropriate i will be presented again in Chapter 15.</p>
