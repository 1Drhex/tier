At the time of the 50th payment, the $7,000 loan would be completely repaid.

                <p style="text-align: left">(a) The true interest rate per quarter is found by equating the equivalent value of the amount borrowed to the equivalent value of the amounts repaid. Equating the AW amounts per quarter, we find</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">$7,000( A/P , <span class="tex-text">\(\acute{i} \%/\)</span> quarter, 50 quarters) = 0.07($7,000) per quarter,</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">( A/P ,<span class="tex-text">\( \acute{i}\%\)</span> , 50 ) = 0.07.<br /> Linearly interpolating to find i%/quarter by using similar triangles is the next step:</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">(A/P, 6%, 50) = 0.0634</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">(A/P, 7%, 50) = 0.0725.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{line d e}{line BA} \)</span>= <span class="tex-text">\(\frac{line Cd}{line CB}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span class="tex-text">\(\frac{7\% -\acute{i}\%}{7\% &#8211; 6\%} \)</span> = <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{0.0725 &#8211; 0.07}{0.0725 &#8211; 0.0634}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span class="tex-text">\(\acute{i}\%\)</span> = <span class="tex-text">\( 7\% &#8211; 1\%\left(\frac{0.0025}{0.0091} \right) \)</span> per quarter.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Now we can compute the effective i′% per year that Albert was paying:</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span class="tex-text">\(\acute{i}\%\)</span> = <span class="tex-text">\( \left[\left(1.0673\right)^{4}-1 \right]100\% \simeq 30\%\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">(b) Even though Albert’s answer of 28% is close to the true value of 30%, his calculation is insensitive to how long his payments were made. For instance, he would get 28% for an answer when 20, 50, or 70 quarterly payments of $490 were made! For 20 quarterly payments, the true effective interest rate is 14.5% per year, and for 70 quarterly payments, it is 31% per year. As more payments are made, the true annual effective interest rate being charged by the bank will increase, but Albert’s method would not reveal by how much.</p>
 <p style="text-align: left">Another Solution<br /> When the initial loan amount, the payment amount, and the number of payments are known, Excel has a useful financial function, RATE (nper, pmt, pv), that will return the interest rate per period. For this example, RATE(50,−490, 7000) = 6.73%. This is the same quarterly interest rate we obtained via linear interpolation in Part (a).</p>
