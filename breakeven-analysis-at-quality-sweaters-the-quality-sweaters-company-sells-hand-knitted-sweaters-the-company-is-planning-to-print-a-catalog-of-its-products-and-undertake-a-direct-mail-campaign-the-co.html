            <p class="blog">BREAKEVEN ANAlySIS AT QUAlITY SWEATERS<br /> The Quality Sweaters Company sells hand-knitted sweaters. The company is planning to print a catalog of its products and undertake a direct mail campaign. The cost of printing the catalog is $20,000 plus $0.10 per catalog. The cost of mailing each catalog (including postage, order forms, and buying names from a mail-order database) is $0.15. In addition, the company plans to include direct reply envelopes in its mailings and incurs $0.20 in extra costs for each direct mail envelope used by a respondent. The average size of a customer order is $40, and the company’s variable cost per order (primarily due to labor and material costs) averages about 80% of the order’s value—that is, $32. The company plans to mail 100,000 catalogs. It wants to develop a spreadsheet model to answer the following questions:</p> <p class="blog">1. How does a change in the response rate affect profit?<br /> 2. For what response rate does the company break even?<br /> 3. If the company estimates a response rate of 3%, should it proceed with the mailing?<br /> 4. How does the presence of uncertainty affect the usefulness of the model?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Business Objectives</strong> To create a model to determine the company’s profit and to see how sensitive the profit is to the response rate from the mailing.<br /> <strong>Excel Objectives</strong> To learn how to work with range names, to learn how to answer what-if questions with one-way data tables, to introduce Excel’s Goal Seek tool, and to learn how to document and audit Excel models with cell comments and Excel’s formula auditing tools.</p>

The big picture for this example appears in Figure 2.11. (See the file Breakeven Analysis Big Picture.xlsx.) It shows that after the company decides how many catalogs to mail, everything else is determined through the given inputs and straightforward calculations. The response rate can then be varied in a sensitivity analysis to see how it affects the profit.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Developing the Spreadsheet Model</strong><br /> The completed spreadsheet model appears in Figure 2.12. (See the file Breakeven Analysis Finished.xlsx.) First, note the clear layout of the model. The input cells are colored blue, they are separated from the outputs, headings are boldface, several headings are indented, numbers are formatted appropriately, and a list to the right spells out all range names we have used. (See the next Excel Tip on how to create this list.) Also, following the convention we use throughout the book, the decision variable (number mailed) is colored red, and the bottom-line output (profit) is colored gray.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Creating Range Names To create a range name for a range of cells (which could be a single cell), highlight the cell(s), click in the Name Box just to the left of the Formula Bar, and type a range name. Alternatively, if a column (or row) of labels appears next to the cells to be range-named, you can use these labels as the range names. To do this, select the labels</p>
 <p class="blog">
and the cells to be named (for example, A4:B5 in Figure 2.12), click Create from Selection on the Formulas ribbon, and make sure the appropriate box in the resulting dialog box (see Figure 2.13) is checked. The labels in our example are to the left of the cells to be named, so the Left column box should be checked. This is a very quick way to create range names, and we did it for all range names in the example. In fact, by keeping your finger on the Ctrl key, you can select multiple ranges<span class="tex-text">\(.^{4}\)</span> After all your ranges are selected, you can sometimes create all your range names in one step. Note that if a label contains any “illegal” range-name characters, such as a space, the illegal characters are converted to underscores.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Pasting Range Names<br /> Including a list of the range names in your spreadsheet is useful for documentation purposes. To do this, select a cell (such as cell G2 in Figure 2.12), select the Use in Formula dropdown list from the Formulas ribbon, and then click the Paste List option. You get a list of all range names and their cell addresses. However, if you change any of these range names (delete one, for example), the pasted list does not update automatically; you have to create it again.</p>
 <p class="blog">
To create this model, you can proceed through the following steps.<br /> 1)Headings and range names. We have named a lot of cells, more than you might want to name, but you will see their value when you create formulas. In general, we strongly support range names, but it is possible to go overboard. You can waste time naming ranges that do not really need to be named. Of course, you can use the Create from Selection shortcut just described to speed up the process.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2)Values of input variables and the decision variable. Enter these values and format them appropriately. As usual, we have used our blue/red/gray color-coding scheme. Note that the number mailed has been designated as a decision variable, not as an input variable (and it is colored red, not blue). This is because the company gets to choose the value of this variable. Finally, note that some of the values have been combined in the statement of the problem. For example, the $32.20 in cell B12 is really 80% of the $40 average order size, plus the $0.20 per return envelope. To document this process, comments appear in a few cells, as shown in Figure 2.14.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Inserting Cell Comments<br /> Inserting comments in cells is a great way to document your spreadsheet models without introducing excessive clutter. To enter a comment in a cell, right-click the cell, select the Insert Comment item, and type your comment. This creates a little red mark in the cell, indicating a comment, and you can see the comment by resting the cursor over the cell. When a cell contains a comment, you can edit or delete the comment by right-clicking the cell and selecting the appropriate item. If you want all the cell comments to be visible (for example, in a printout as in Figure 2.14), click the File tab (or Office button in Excel</p>
 <p class="blog">
2007), then Options (Excel Options in Excel 2007), then the Advanced link, and select the Comment &amp; Indicator option from the Display group. Note that the Indicator Only option is the default.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3)Model the responses. You have not yet specified the response rate to the mailing, so enter any reasonable value, such as 8%, in the Response_rate cell. You will perform sensitivity on this value later on. Then enter the formula</p>
 <p class="blog">
=Number_mailed*Response_rate</p>
 <p class="blog">
in cell E5. (Are you starting to see the advantage of range names?)</p>
 <p class="blog">
4)Model the revenue, costs, and profits. Enter the formula<br /> =Number_of_responses*Average_order<br /> in cell E8; enter the formulas<br /> =Fixed_cost_of_printing<br /> =Variable_cost_of_printing_mailing*Number_mailed<br /> and<br /> =Number_of_responses*Variable_cost_per_order<br /> in cells E9, E10, and E11; enter the formula<br /> =SUM(E9:E11)<br /> in cell E12; and enter the formula<br /> =5Total_revenue−Total_cost<br /> in cell E13. These formulas should all be self-explanatory, especially because of the range names used.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tip</strong>: Entering Formulas with Range Names</p>
 <p class="blog">
To enter a formula that contains range names, you do not have to type the full range names.You actually have two convenient options. One, you can point to the cells, and range names will appear in your formulas. Or two, you can start typing the range name in the formula and, after a few letters, Excel will show you a list you can choose from.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Forming a One-Way Data Table<br /> Now that a basic model has been created, the questions posed by the company can be answered. For question 1, you can form a one-way data table to show how profit varies with the response rate as shown in Figure 2.15. Data tables are used often in this book, so make sure you understand how to create them. We will walk you through the procedure once or twice, but from then on, you are on your own. First, enter a sequence of trial values of the response rate in column A, and enter a link to profit in cell B17 with the formula =Profit. This cell is shaded for emphasis, but this isn’t necessary. (In general, other outputs could be part of the table, and they would be placed in columns C, D, and so on. There would be a link to each output in row 17.) Finally, select the entire table range, A17:B27, and select Data Table from the What-If Analysis dropdown list on the Data ribbon to bring up the dialog box in Figure 2.16. Fill it in as shown to indicate that the only input, Response_rate, is listed along a column. (You can enter either a range name or a cell address in this dialog box. The easiest way is to point to the cell.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
When you click OK, Excel substitutes each response rate value in the table into the Response_rate cell, recalculates profit, and reports it in the table. For a final touch, you can create a chart of the values in the data table. (To do this, select the A18:B27 range and select the type of chart you want from the Insert ribbon. Then you can fix it up by adding titles and making other modifications to suit your taste.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: One-Way Data Table<br /> A one-way data table allows you to see how one or more outputs vary as a single input varies over a selected range of values. These input values can be arranged vertically in a column or horizontally in a row. We will explain only the vertical arrangement because it is the most common. To create the table, enter the input values in a column range, such as A18:A27 of Figure 2.15, and enter links to one or more output cells in columns to the right and one row above the inputs, as in cell B17 of Figure 2.15. Then select the entire table, beginning with the upper-left blank cell (A17 in the figure), select Data Table from the What-If Analysis dropdown list on the Data ribbon, and fill in the resulting dialog box as in Figure 2.16. Leave the Row Input cell blank<br /> and use the cell where the original value of the input lives as the Column Input cell. When you click OK, each value in the left column of the table is substituted into the column input cell, the spreadsheet recalculates, and the resulting value of the output is placed in the table. Also, if you click anywhere in the body of the table (B18:B27 in the figure), you will see that Excel has entered the TABLE function to remind you that a data table lives here. Note that the column input cell<br /> must be on the same worksheet as the table itself; otherwise, Excel issues an error.</p>

Fundamental Insight</p>
 <p class="blog">
The Power of Data Tables<br /> Unfortunately, many Excel users (most of them?) are unaware of data tables, which are among the most powerful and useful tools Excel has to offer. After you have developed a model that relates inputs to outputs, you can then build data tables in a matter of seconds to see how the outputs vary as key inputs vary over some range. Data tables are the perfect means for answering a large number of what-if questions quickly and easily.</p>
 <hr /> <p class="blog">
As the chart indicates, profit increases in a linear manner as the response rate varies. More specifically, each percentage point increase in the response rate increases profit by $7800.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Here is the reasoning. Each percentage point increase in response rate results in 100,000(0.01) = 1000 more orders. Each order yields a revenue of $40, on average, but incurs a variable cost of $32.20. The net gain in profit is $7.80 per order, or $7,800 for 1000 orders.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using Goal Seek<br /> From the data table, you can see that profit changes from negative to positive when the response rate is somewhere between 5% and 6%. Question 2 asks for the exact breakeven point. You could find this by trial and error, but it is easier to use Excel’s Goal Seek tool. Essentially, Goal Seek is used to solve a single equation in a single unknown. Here, the equation is Profit = 0, and the unknown is the response rate. In Excel terminology, the unknown is called the changing cell because you can change it to make the equation true. To implement Goal Seek, select Goal Seek from the What-If Analysis dropdown list on the Data ribbon and fill in the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 2.17. (Range names or cell addresses can be used in the top and bottom boxes, but a number must be entered in the middle box.) After you click OK, the Response_rate and Profit cells have values 5.77% and $0. In words, if the response rate is 5.77%, the company breaks even. If the response rate is greater than 5.77%, the company makes money; if the rate is less than 5.77%, the company loses money. Of course, this assumes that the company mails 100,000 catalogs. If it sends more or fewer catalogs, the breakeven response rate will change.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: Goal Seek<br /> The purpose of the Goal Seek tool is to solve one equation in one unknown. Specifically, Goal Seek allows you to vary a single input cell to force a single output cell to a selected value. To use it, select Goal Seek from the What-If Analysis dropdown list on the Data ribbon and fill in the resulting dialog box in Figure 2.17. Enter a reference to the output cell in the Set cell box, enter the numeric value you want the output cell to equal in the To value box, and enter a reference to the input cell in the By changing cell box. Note that Goal Seek sometimes stops when the Set cell is close, but not exactly equal to, the desired value. To improve Goal Seek’s accuracy, click the File tab (the Office button in Excel 2007), then Options (Excel Options in Excel 2007), and then the Formulas link. Then check the Enable iterative calculation box and reduce Maximum Change to any desired level of precision. We chose a precision level of 0.000001. For this level of precision, Goal Seek searches until profit is within 0.000001 of the desired value, $0.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Limitations of the Model<br /> Question 3 asks whether the company should proceed with the mailing if the response rate is only 3%. From the data table (see Figure 2.15), the apparent answer is no, because profit is negative. However, like many companies, we are taking a short-term view with this reasoning. The model does not include the fact that many customers who respond to direct mail will reorder in the future. The company nets $7.80 per order. If each of the respondents ordered two more times, say, the company would earn 3000($7.80)(2) = $46,800 more than appears in the model, and profit would then be positive. The moral is that managers must look at the long-term impact of their decisions. However, if you want to incorporate the long term explicitly into the model, you must build a more complex model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<strong>Finally</strong>, question 4 asks about the impact of uncertainty in the model. Obviously, not all model inputs are known with certainty. For example, the size of an order is not always $40— it might range, say, from $10 to $100. When there is a high degree of uncertainty about model inputs, it makes little sense to talk about the profit level or the breakeven response rate. It makes more sense to talk about the probability that profit will have a certain value or the probability that the company will at least break even. You will see how this can be done in the following example and in many more such examples in Chapters 9 through 11.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using the Formula Auditing Tool<br /> The model in this example is fairly small and simple. Even so, you can use a handy Excel tool to see how all the parts fit together. This is the Formula Auditing tool, which is available on the Formulas ribbon. See Figure 2.18.<br /> The Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents buttons are probably the most useful buttons in this group. To see which formulas have direct links to the Number_of_ responses cell, select this cell and click the Trace Dependents button. Arrows are drawn to each cell that directly depends on the number of responses, as shown in Figure 2.19. Alternatively, to see which cells are used to create the formula in the Total_revenue cell, select this cell and click the Trace Precedents button. Now you see that the Average_order and Number_of_responses cells are used directly to calculate revenue, as shown in Figure 2.20.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Using these two buttons, you can trace your logic (or someone else’s logic) as far backward or forward as you like. When you are finished, just click the Remove Arrows button.</p>

<strong>Excel Tool</strong>: Formula Auditing Toolbar<br /> The formula auditing toolbar allows you to see dependents of a selected cell (which cells have formulas that reference this cell) or precedents of a given cell (which cells are referenced in this cell’s formula). In fact, you can even see dependents or precedents that reside on a different worksheet. In this case, the auditing arrows appear as dashed lines and point to a small spreadsheet icon. By double-clicking the dashed line, you can see a list of dependents or precedents on other worksheets. These tools are especially useful for understanding how someone else’s spreadsheet works.</p>

Modeling Issues<br /> Is the spreadsheet layout in Figure 2.14 the best possible layout? This question is not too crucial because this model is so small. However, we have put all the inputs together (usually a good practice), and we have placed all the outputs together in a logical order. You might want to place the answers to questions 1 and 2 on separate worksheets, but with such a small model, it is arguably better to keep everything on a single worksheet. We generally avoid separate worksheets unless things start getting bigger and more complex.<br /> One other issue is the placement of the chart. From the Chart Tools Design ribbon, you can click the Move Chart button to select whether you want to place the chart on the worksheet (floating above the cells) or on a separate chart sheet that has no rows or columns. This choice depends on your personal preference—neither choice is necessarily better than the other—but for this small model, we favor keeping everything on a single worksheet.<br /> Finally, we could have chosen the number mailed, rather than the response rate, as the basis for a sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis is typically based on an uncertain input variable, such as the response rate, or a decision variable that the decision maker controls. Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of data tables you can create for a particular model.</p>
