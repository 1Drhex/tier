            <p class="blog">A construction company is negotiating on a construction project with a six-month duration. On the last day of each month the construction company may bill the owner for the work completed during the month. The owner pays the monthly bills one month after they are received. For example, the construction company receives payment for work completed during June on July 31. The owner also holds 10% retention. Final payment is expected one month after completion of the project and will include payment of the retention. The construction company pays material suppliers in full when it receives payment from the owner. The construction company pays subcontractors when it receives payment from the owner but withholds 10% from the subcontractor’s payment. The construction company pays for labor weekly. The projected monthly material, labor, and subcontractor costs, as well as the amount the construction company will bill the project’s owner each month, are shown in Table 1 . Determine the monthly cash flows and the total cash generated by the project at the end of each month and just before each payment is received from the project’s owner. What is the maximum amount of cash invested by the company during the completion of the project?</p> <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="height: 317px;" width="475"> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="5" width="410">Table 1 Monthly Costs and Billings for Example 3</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan="3">Costs</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Month</td> <td>Materials ($)</td> <td>Labor ($)</td> <td>Sub.

To analyze the cash needs of this project, we begin at the beginning of the project and work our way to the end of the project, calculating the cash flow and total cash generated at the end of each month and just before each payment is received from the project’s owner. Be-cause the first payment from the owner is not received until the second month, the first point in time where we calculate the total cash generated by the project is at the end of the first month. For the first month, the peak cash flow occurs at the end of the month. Because material suppliers and subcontractors are paid only when the construction company receives payment from the owner, no material or subcontractor payments are made during the first month. Payments are made to labor during the month. To simplify calculations, we assume that all labor is paid during the month the work is performed, although some of the costs may be paid during the first week of the following month. At the end of the first month the construction company has paid $34,900 to cover the cost of the labor. The cash flow for the first month is calculated using Eq. (1) as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{n}= Cash Receipts_{n}-Cash Disbursements_{n}\)</span> <span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{n}= Cash Receipts_{n} &#8211; (Material Payments_{n} + Labor Payments_{n} + Subcontractor Payments_{n}) \)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{1} \)</span>= $0 &#8211; ($0 + $34,900 + $0) = -$34,900</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total cash generated by the project by the end of the first month is calculated using eq. (2) as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{1}=Cash _{0}+Cash Flow_{1}\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{1}\)</span>= $0 + (-$34,900) = -$34,900</p>
 <p class="blog">
At the end of the first month the construction company will have $34,900 of cash invested in the project.<br /> The next point in time where we need to calculate total cash generated by the project is just before receipt of the first payment from the owner, which occurs at the end of the second month. No additional payments have been made to suppliers and subcontractors during this part of the month.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The construction company has paid out $48,900 to cover the cost of the labor performed during the second month. This cash flow is calculated using Eq. (1) as follows:</p>

<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{2 َ} \)</span>= $0 &#8211; ($0 + $48,900 + $0) = -$48,900</p>

The total cash generated by the project just before the first payment is received from the project’s owner is calculated using Eq. (3) as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{2 َ}=Cash _{1} +Cash Flow_{2 َ}\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{2 َ}\)</span>= -$34,900 + (-$48,900) = -$83,800</p>
 <p class="blog">
Just before the construction company receives payment from the owner during the second month, the construction company will have $83,800 of cash invested in the project.</p>
 <p class="blog">
At the end of the second month the construction company will have received the first payment from the owner. The payment will be equal to the work billed at the end of the first month less the 10% retention. The payment received from the owner during the second month is calculated as follows:</p>
 <span class="tex-text">\(Cash Receipt _{n}=Bill _{n-1}(1 &#8211; Retention Rate)\)</span> <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Receipt _{2}\)</span>= $129,600(1 &#8211; 0.10) = $116,640</p>
 <p class="blog">
During the month the construction company will have paid out $30,400 to material suppliers, $48,900 to cover the cost of the labor, and the first month’s subcontractor costs— less the 10% retention. The subcontractor payments for the second month are as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\( Subcontractor Payments _{2}\)</span>= $54,700(1 &#8211; 0.10) = $49,230</p>

The cash flow for the second month is calculated using Eq. (1) as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{2} \)</span>= $116,640 &#8211; ($30,400 + $48,900 + $49,230)</p>

The total cash generated by the project by the end of the second month is calculated using Eq. (2) as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{2} \)</span>= -$34,900 + (-$11,890) = -$46,790</p>
 <p class="blog">
The maximum amount of cash needed during the second month is $37,010 ($83,800 &#8211; $46,790) more than the amount of cash needed at the end of the month. The cash flows and the amount of cash needed for the third through the sixth month are calculated in a similar manner and are shown in Table 2 .<br /> The next point in time where we need to calculate total cash generated by the project is just before receipt of the last payment from the owner, which occurs at the end of the seventh month. During this month the construction company has not paid any additional labor costs; therefore, the total cash generated by the project just before the payment is received equals the total cash generated by the project at the end of the previous month for a total of $11,430. The payment received from the owner during the seventh month will include the full amount of the bill from the sixth month plus the retention withheld from the previous months. The retention held during the first six months is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Retention = $0 + $129,600(0.10) + $248,400(0.10) + $313,200(0.10) + $183,600(0.10) + $129,600(0.10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Retention = $100,440</p>
 <p class="blog">
The seventh month’s payment from the owner is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Receipt_{7} \)</span>= $100,440 + $75,600 = $176,040</p>
 <p class="blog">
During the month, the construction company will have paid out $15,400 to material suppliers and will have to pay for the sixth month’s subcontractor costs plus all of the retention held during the first six months. The retention held from the subcontractor payments during the first six months is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Retention = $0 + $54,700(0.10) + $123,800(0.10) + $136,400(0.10) + $106,800(0.10) + $66,000(0.10)</p>
 <p class="blog">
Retention = $48,770</p>
 <p class="blog">
The seventh month’s payment to the subcontractors is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Subcontractor Payments_{7} \)</span>= $48,770 + $43,300 = $92,070</p>
 <p class="blog">
The cash flow for the seventh month is calculated using Eq. (1) as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash Flow_{7} \)</span>= $176,040 &#8211; ($15,400 + $0 + $92,070) = $68,570</p>
 <p class="blog">
The total cash generated by the project at the end of the seventh month is calculated using Eq. (2) as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(Cash _{7} \)</span>=$11,430 + $68,570 = $80,000</p>
 <p class="blog">
At this point the project is complete. At the completion of the project the cash generated by the project should equal the gross profit realized on the project, which equals the profit and overhead markup for this example. The monthly cash flow and the cash generated at the end of each month are shown in Table 2 . The cash generated by the project just before payment from the owner and at the end of the month are shown in Figure 6 .</p>

The maximum amount of cash invested in the project by the construction company occurs in the third month and is $119,890, which is greater than the profit and overhead markup on the project. For the construction company to complete this project, it would need about $120,000 in cash.</p>
