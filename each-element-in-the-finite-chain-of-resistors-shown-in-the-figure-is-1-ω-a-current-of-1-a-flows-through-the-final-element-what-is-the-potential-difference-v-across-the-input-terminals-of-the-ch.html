Number the resistors, starting with the last element in the chain. As a current of <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \ A \)</span> flows through the first resistor, a current of <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \ A \)</span> has to flow through the second one as well, thus there is a potential difference (p.d.) of <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \ V \)</span> across each resistor. As a consequence, the p.d. across the third resistor is <span class="tex-text">\( (1 + 1) = 2 \ V, \)</span> and the current flowing through it must be <span class="tex-text">\(2 \ A.\)</span> The current flowing through the next resistor is <span class="tex-text">\( (1 + 2) = 3 \ A. \)</span> The current in the fifth resistor can be determined using the p.d. <span class="tex-text">\( (2 + 3) = 5 \ V\)</span> across the resistors with currents of <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( 3 \ A,\)</span> respectively, flowing through them, and so on, as shown in Fig. S158.1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Consider the chain of resistors to be built starting with the last element and then connecting the consecutive elements, alternately in series and parallell, throughout the chain. The sum of the currents flowing through the two previous resistors flows through the following series resistor (Kirchhoff&#8217;s first law). The next element connected in parallel creates a new loop in the chain, and therefore the p.d. across this resistor equals the sum of the p.d.s across the two previous ones (Kirchhoff&#8217;s second law). Since the numerical values of the p.d. and the current are identical for a <span class="tex-text">\( 1-Ω \)</span> resistor, the sum of the currents of the two previous resistors is the same as the current of the new resistor connected in parallel. Thus, in this so-called ladder circuit, Kirchhoff&#8217;s laws are satisfied in such a way that the current flowing through each resistor (and the p.d. across it) is equal to the sum of the corresponding quantities for the two previous elements.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice that the numerical values of the currents (or p.d.s) are the terms of the Fibonacci series: <span class="tex-text">\( 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. \)</span> The p.d. across the two last resistors is <span class="tex-text">\( (21 + 13) = 34 \ V, \)</span> and this must also be the p.d. across the circuit input. As a total of <span class="tex-text">\( 21 \ A \)</span> flow as the result of applying a p.d. of <span class="tex-text">\( 34 \ V, \)</span> the equivalent resistance of the circuit is of <span class="tex-text">\( 34/21 = 1.619 05 Ω.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
If one more element is connected to the chain (in parallel) then the p.d. across it is unchanged at <span class="tex-text">\( 34 \ V, \)</span> but the total current increases to <span class="tex-text">\( (21 +34) =55 A. \)</span> In this case the equivalent resistance is <span class="tex-text">\( 34/55 = 0.61818 Ω.\)</span> If yet another element is connected to the circuit, a current of <span class="tex-text">\( 55 \ A\)</span> flows through it and the input p.d. increases to <span class="tex-text">\( (34 + 55) = 89 \ V. \)</span> The total resistance of the chain is then <span class="tex-text">\( 89/55 = 1.61818 \ Ω.\)</span> If the ladder circuit is extended further and further, an &#8216;infinite&#8217; chain is obtained. The equivalent resistance of this chain can be calculated using the fact that adding two more elements does not change its resistance. Thus, the whole chain can be replaced by a single resistor of resistance <span class="tex-text">\( R, \)</span> which is such that if two <span class="tex-text">\( 1-Ω \)</span> resistors are connected to it, one in parallel and the other in series with the combination, the equivalent resistance of the new circuit will also be <span class="tex-text">\( R \)</span>(see Fig. S158.2).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The condition for this is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( R=1\ \Omega +\frac{1}{(1/1 \ \Omega )+(1/R)} , \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
which yields the following quadratic equation for the numerical value of <span class="tex-text">\( R,\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( R^2-R-1=0. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The positive root of this equation gives the equivalent resistance for an &#8216;infinite&#8217; chain as,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( R=\frac{1+ \sqrt{5}}{2}≈1.61803 \ Ω. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
We see that the equivalent resistance of a chain of eight-ten elements approximates very well that of the &#8216;infinite&#8217; chain. Hence a ladder circuit with relatively few elements can be considered as infinite.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Note.</em> (i) In practice, the neutral wires of overhead electric supply networks can be considered as ladder circuits; the neutral wires are fastened to poles and earthed at, say, every tenth pole. Such a ladder circuit consists of two types of resistors, but the equivalent resistance of the &#8216;infinite&#8217; chain can be calculated using the above method.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(ii) It is of interest to note that the above quadratic equation is the golden ratio equation, the solution of which is the golden mean, <span class="tex-text">\( (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 = 1.618 03 &#8230;. \)</span> As shown, this is the same as the numerical value of the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder circuit. Furthermore, the ratio of consecutive elements of the Fibonacci series was shown to approach the golden mean surprisingly quickly. It is also easy to prove that dividing the even elements by the previous odd ones, the golden mean is approached from below, while dividing the odd elements by the previous even ones, it is approached from above.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Finally, for the sake of the aesthetic pleasure produced by multiple-level fractions, it is worth expressing with <span class="tex-text">\( 1 s \)</span> the equivalent resistance of the infinite chain made up of <span class="tex-text">\( 1-Ω \)</span> resistors. This time, the elements are considered in order, not from the end but from the beginning, i.e. starting at the left hand end of the chain:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( R=1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\cdot \cdot \cdot } } } } } } . \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
If the <span class="tex-text">\( · · · \)</span> at the end of the formula is replaced by a <span class="tex-text">\( 1, \)</span> then the equivalent resistance of the original eight-element chain is obtained.</p>
