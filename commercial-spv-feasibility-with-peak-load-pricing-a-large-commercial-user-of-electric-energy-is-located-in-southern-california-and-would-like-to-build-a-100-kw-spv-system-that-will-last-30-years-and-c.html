            <p class="blog"><strong>Commercial SPV Feasibility with Peak-Load Pricing</strong></p> <p class="blog">A large commercial user of electric energy is located in Southern California and would like to build a 100 kW SPV system that will last 30 years and cost $4,000/kW, installed. The annually averaged insolation at its location is 5.63 kWh/m<span class="tex-text">\(^{2}\)</span>/day.<br /> The company will use the 30 percent federal tax credit for solar power systems and assumes that 50 percent bonus depreciation will be available. There is no SITC for renewables, but the California Solar Initiative (CSI) is a state-mandated public utility rebate program that now pays $0.025/kWh to commercial users for the first five years of operation of an SPV system that is 30 kW or larger. (The program started in 2007 with payments of $0.39/kWh, but the rate has decreased as the state approaches its goals for renewable power capacity.)<br /> The firm is subject to a two-part tariff that charges $220/kW of peak demand in the year and $0.05/kWh of energy used, inclusive of state sales tax. The company expects energy prices to rise at 2.5 percent per year for the next several decades.<br /> The firm’s usage pattern has a load factor of 35 percent and a total energy use that averages 200,000 kWh per month. The company’s peak in August is due to its high need for air conditioning, which runs on electric energy. The peak always occurs on a sunny day, so if the company were to install 100 kWh of SPV panels, it would not only be able to supply energy over the year but reduce its peak power demand charge. However, on a hot August day, the solar panel would likely be operating at a temperature of 55°C.<br /> The company uses a nominal discount rate of 8 percent per year on cost-saving projects. Its federal income tax rate is 39.6 percent and its state income tax rate is 8.84 percent.</p> <p class="blog">(a) What is the peak power demand of this company? Would a 100 kW solar array overpower the firm?<br /> (b) What is the present value of the net initial investment?<br /> (c) Is this SPV project financially viable?<br /> (d) <em>Sensitivity analysis on the solution.</em> What difference would there be in the profitability of the project if the developer could build the project at $3,750/kW rather than $4,000? Hold to the $3,750 capacity cost, but consider the result if the CSI meets its capacity goal before the project is submitted for a CSI rebate, and the rebate is no longer available? Hold to the $3,750 capacity cost, and keep the CSI rebate, but take away the bonus depreciation. What effect would that have?<br /> (e) What is the average cost of electric energy for this firm?<br /> (f) What conclusions would the analysis give if the peak-load pricing were ignored and the analysis conducted in the manner of , using only the average cost of electric energy as the cost savings from using the SPV unit?</p>

(a) The company’s peak power demand can be calculated from the company’s load factor and the total energy consumption. The definitional equation says</p>
 <p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 80px"><span class="tex-text">\(L = \frac{E}{8760 \times P} \)</span><em>(Definition of Load Factor)</em></p>
 <p class="blog">
but the <em>E</em> is the annual energy usage by the firm. We are given that the monthly average usage is 200,000 kWh, so we use 35 percent for the load factor and 200,000 × 12 for E, then solve for P,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\(0.35 = \frac{200,000\times 12}{8760 \times P}\)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( P = \frac{200,000 \times 12}{8760 \times 0.35} \)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( P = 782.78 kW\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
As the peak power demand is about 783 kW, the 100 kW solar array will satisfy only a small fraction of that demand. It will not overpower the firm.<br /> The basic data from the problem can be set up in a spreadsheet as shown in Figure 9.7.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(b) We begin with an analysis of the net initial investment, meaning net of the federal tax credit and depreciation tax shield. Figure 9.8 shows the result as a net investment of $215,498 in year 0 dollars. A key difference between this example and the Headley Corporation case of  is that the California rebate is earned each year for five years, so there is no one-time rebate. Correspondingly, in Figure 9.8, cell B26 is zeroed out, and the rebate percentage in B17 is used in a special line of the income statement (cell B44) shown in Figure 9.9.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(c) The annual benefits and costs depend on both the production of energy and the power output of the SPV system at the time of the company’s peak load in August. The demand charge is $220/kW/yr and the energy charge is $0.05/kWh. Annually, the SPV system will produce 100 kW × 0.77 (derate) × 5.63 (kWh/kW/day) × 365 days = 158,231 kWh (cell B39 in Figure 9.9). The amount of power that can be shaved from the firm’s peak is the AC output of the SPV system, which is significantly affected by the operating tem­perature at the time of the August peak demand. That AC output will be the rated capacity of 100 kW multiplied by the derate factor 0.77, multiplied again by the temperature derating factor, which is calculated from an efficiency loss of (55 − 25) × 0.5% = 15%. The AC output on the peak summer day will therefore be 100 × 0.77 × (1−15%) = 65.45 kW. That saves 65.45 × 220 = $14,399 per year on the demand charge. The savings on the energy charge is 158,231 kWh × 0.05 $/kWh = $7,912. The total annual savings is therefore $22,311.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This analysis calculates the annual energy production using the <em>effective annual </em>insolation for the location given in the statement of the problem. This number was taken from PVWatts as in  and thereby reflects a temperature derating based on the <em>average monthly </em>temperature at the location. Although PVWatts does account for the fact that the normal operating cell temperature (NOCT) is hotter than the air temperature, even that allowance is based on an average over time. When a company pays for electric service under peak-load pricing, most of its annual cost is accounted for by the power drawn during the hottest 15-minute interval of the year, and PVWatts does not track such data. That is a time when there is likely to be full sun and little or no wind to cool the SPV unit. In our analysis of production during the peak 15-minute period, we had to make a specific assumption about the panel temperature, here 55°C (131°F), although the air temperature in a peak Iowa summer day will not be more than 104°F (40°C).</p>
 <p class="blog">
The CSI rebate provides 0.025 ($/kWh) × 158,231 kWh = $3,956 per year for the first five years, which, conveniently for this analysis, coincide with the depreciation period.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Maintenance expenses are estimated at $20/kW per year, mean­ing $2,000. The calculation of annual cash flows and of their present values appears in Figure 9.9.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The project shows an NPV of <em>positive </em>$11,873, which indicates a <em>Go </em>decision on the project. Another perspective on the profitability of this project is seen in the calculation of the project’s internal rate of return (IRR). For a cash flow that consists of an initial invest­ment and a (constant) annuity of benefits in the future, the spread­sheet RATE function will calculate a rate of return. However, this cash flow consists of two annuity segments, so RATE will not work. Instead, we use the spreadsheet’s Goal Seek routine. The project’s rate of return is defined as the discount rate that would cause the NPV to be zero. The firm’s discount rate is located in cell B14. The NPV of the project is in cell B53. We pass these cell addresses to the Goal Seek routine in its dialog box as shown in Figure 9.10.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Hitting <em>OK </em>starts the Goal Seek routine, which changes the con­tent of cell B14. When Goal Seek reports a solution, as shown in Figure 9.11, one must hit <em>OK </em>to hold the solution. Then look for that solution in cell B14 of the financial model. In this case, the number 8.6 percent would be found in cell B14, so the project has a profitability of 8.6 percent per year. This is above the firm’s 8 percent hurdle rate, which we would expect, because the NPV was positive. (Note: After each use of Goal Seek, the new value, here 8.6 percent, will remain until the old value, here the firm’s 8 percent discount rate, is restored by hand.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
(d) <em>Sensitivity analysis on the solution</em>. Sensitivity analysis is easy to perform when the solution is set up in a spreadsheet such as this. After setting the firm’s discount rate in B14 back to 8 percent, we conduct the following analyses.<br /> <em>Loss of Bonus Depreciation</em>. Setting the bonus depreciation percentage in cell B18 to 0, we look at cell B53 and find that the NPV has gone from the base case result of +11,873 to −11,309. The project is not viable without the bonus depreciation! The corresponding IRR is only 7.5 percent per year, not high enough to clear the firm’s hurdle rate of 8 percent.<br /> <em>Lower Installed Cost</em>. Holding to the loss of the bonus depreciation, would the project become profitable again if the installed cost could be negotiated from $4,000/kW down to $3,750/kW? We set the discount rate in B14 back to 8 percent and change the capacity cost in B3 to 3,750. The result is an NPV of <em>positive</em> $105, which is barely above zero, but it does indicate a Go decision. The corresponding IRR is 8.01 percent, which is barely above the firm’s hurdle rate 8 percent, as the NPV was just barely above zero.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Loss of the CSI.</em> What would happen to this project if the CSI meets its capacity goal before the project can be submitted for a CSI rebate, and the rebate is no longer available? Let us continue with the assumption that the bonus depreciation is not available. At the installed cost of $3,750, the project was essentially at break-even. A loss of the CSI rebate would send the NPV negative and the rate of return below 8 percent. The question now will be, “What (lower) capacity cost would just compensate for the loss of the CSI?” In other words, without the CSI, what is the break-even capacity cost? To find the answer, we reset the discount rate cell B14 back to 8 percent, keep the capacity cost in B3 at 3,750, but set the CSI rate in cell B17 to 0. The result in cell B53 is an NPV of negative $9,843, as expected. We find the break-even capacity cost using Goal seek’s dialog box, “Set cell B53 (NPV) to 0 by changing cell B3 (capacity cost).” The result in B3 is $3,534, meaning that the capacity cost would have to be at or below $3,534 to make the project viable if the CSI rebate is not available.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(e) The average cost of energy to this user is given by a generalized form of the text’s <em>average cost equation</em>. In , where the demand charge was $180/kW and the energy charge was $0.03/kWh, the average cost equation appeared as <span class="tex-text">\( a = \frac {180}{E/P} + 0.03\)</span>, where E is the annual energy production (kWh) and P is the peak demand (kW). If we write d for the demand price and e for the energy price, the general form of the average cost equation is <span class="tex-text">\(a= ^{a=\frac{d}{E/P}+e}+e\)</span>. In this problem, d = $220/kW, e = $0.05/kWh, E = 200,000 kWh/month × 12 months = 2,400,000 kWh/year, and P was calculated in part (a) to be 783 kW. The average cost is therefore a = <span class="tex-text">\(\frac {220}{2400000/783}\)</span> + 0.05 = 0.072 + 0.050 = 0.122, meaning $0.122/kWh.</p>
 <p class="blog">
(f) If the firm had been subjected to ordinary pricing at $0.122/kWh, it would have paid 158,231 (kWh) × 0.122 ($/kWh) = $19,265 per year for the energy produced by the solar panels. Using the peak-load pricing formula and explicit temperature derating at the time of the summer peak, we found in the spreadsheet line 43 a total avoided cost, hence savings, of $22,311. This shows that the average energy price underestimated the savings that would result under peak-load pricing. By using $0.122 for the energy price in cell B12 and 0 for the demand charge in B13, the spreadsheet would show that the average energy price model predicts an NPV of <em>negative</em> $12,013 in the base case. This would have indicated an incorrect No Go decision rather than the favorable decision derived using peak-load pricing correctly in part (c).</p>
