In order to simplify the calculation, choose a system of units in which the initial volume and the external pressure are unity, and the units of the number of moles and the gas constant have a product that is also unity. This reduces the usual ideal gas equation <span class="tex-text">\( p V = nR T \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( p V = T. \)</span> In this system, the molar heat has to be multiplied by the gas constant to yield the normal molar heat capacity.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The initial pressure of the air is given by the sum of the pressure of the <span class="tex-text">\( 76 \ cm-high \)</span> column of mercury and the atmospheric pressure, a total of <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> units. Any increase in length of the air column implies a corresponding decrease in the mercury one. Therefore as the air expands from <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> units, its pressure decreases linearly from <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( 1 \)</span> units as shown in Fig. S135.1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The temperature of the enclosed air is initially <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> units, and is still <span class="tex-text">\( 2 \)</span> units at the end of the straight section shown in the figure, since both points lie on the isothermal <span class="tex-text">\( p V = 2.\)</span> In our representation, the isothermals are symmetrical about the bisector of the axes (i.e. about the line <span class="tex-text">\( p = V\)</span> ). Thus the highest temperature reached corresponds to the isothermal to which the straight-line segment is tangential. As shown in Fig. S135.1, this occurs at the middle of the process, when <span class="tex-text">\( p = \frac{3}{2} \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( V = \frac{3}{2}. \)</span> The maximum temperature is therefore <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{9}{4}.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The equation of the straight line representing the process is <span class="tex-text">\( p = 3- V.\)</span> Applying the first law of thermodynamics to a typical section of the line gives</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{5}{2} ΔT =C ΔT -p ΔV,\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
where the left-hand side of the equation is the change in the internal energy of the air (diatomic molecules have, <span class="tex-text">\( C_V = \frac{5}{2}R \)</span>), and on the right-hand side, <span class="tex-text">\( C \)</span> is the molar heat in question. Expressing <span class="tex-text">\( p \)</span> as <span class="tex-text">\( p = 3 &#8211; V \)</span> in the equation <span class="tex-text">\( p V = T, \)</span> gives <span class="tex-text">\( (3 &#8211; V) V = T.\)</span> From this it follows that small changes in <span class="tex-text">\( V \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( T \)</span> are connected by <span class="tex-text">\( (3- 2V) ΔV = ΔT.\)</span> The change in the internal energy of the air then becomes</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{5}{2}\Delta T=C\ \Delta T-\frac{3-V}{3-2V}\Delta T, \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
which simplifies to</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( C=\frac{21-12V}{6-4V} . \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure S135.2 shows this result for the molar heat plotted against volume. The curve is singular (the molar heat approaches infinity) at <span class="tex-text">\( V = 3/2 \)</span> because at this point the straight line is a good approximation to the isothermal corresponding to the maximum temperature. During an isothermal process, heat is transferred but the temperature does not change, and this is why the molar heat tends to infinity. Beyond this point, the molar heat becomes negative, which means that in spite of the positive heat transfer, the internal energy of the air decreases because the work done by it in expanding is greater than the heat transferred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The most interesting part of the process occurs when <span class="tex-text">\( V = \frac{7}{4} \)</span>, i.e. when only a quarter of the mercury is left in the tube. At this point the molar heat is zero and implies that the process is adiabatic, since there is a change of temperature without any heat transfer; at this point, the straight line describing the process is tangential to an adiabatic curve. Beyond this point, the temperature decreases further but the molar heat becomes positive; this can only correspond to the system being cooled.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If more heat is given to the system, the representative point no longer follows the straight line but continues along the adiabatic one. The temperature of the air does decrease, but not by as much as the straight line would suggest. The decrease in the internal energy of the air is equal to the work done against atmospheric pressure (whilst lifting the mercury) and in accelerating the ejected mercury.<br /> Returning to the original question, that of the heat transfer necessary to push the mercury out of the tube, it can be seen that it is only necessary to transfer heat whilst <span class="tex-text">\( V \)</span> is in the range <span class="tex-text">\( V = 1 \)</span> to <span class="tex-text">\( V = \frac{7}{4}·\)</span> Simple arithmetic shows that the work done by the air up to this point is (in this system of units) <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{39}{32},\)</span> whilst the increase in internal energy is <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{15}{32}.\)</span> The required heat transfer is therefore <span class="tex-text">\( Q = \frac{27}{16}.\)</span> In standard units, this means that if the column of mercury originally enclosed <span class="tex-text">\( n \)</span> moles of air, then the heat transfer required to remove it is <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{27}{16}nR. \)</span></p>
