            <p class="blog">Marvin and Chiquita (see previous case studies) have been working very successfully<br /> together, so on 1 July 2013, the start of Marvin’s third year in business, they decided<br /> to form a ‘conventional’ partnership (i.e. not an LLP), to be called Machiq Partners,<br /> sharing profits or losses in the ratio Marvin 3/5 and Chiquita 2/5. All of Marvin’s assets<br /> and liabilities are transferred to the partnership at their depreciated value. This totals<br /> £17,570, which is transferred to Marvin’s capital account. Chiquita pays in £10,000 as<br /> her capital. No payment was required for any goodwill built up by Marvin in the previous<br /> two years.<br /> They agree that no interest should be charged on their drawings or credited on their<br /> capital balances. No salaries are to be paid to either partner. During a successful year<br /> together the partnership earned an operating profit of £58,800. Marvin had drawings of<br /> £32,850 and Chiquita drew £18,520.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong><br /> (a) Show the relevant extracts from the partnership income statement for the year<br /> ended 30 June 2014 (appropriation section) and its statement of financial position at<br /> that date.<br /> On 30 June 2014, the partners received the following letter from Esmeralda, Marvin’s<br /> former assistant:<br /> Dear Marvin<br /> My seven brothers and sisters and I have consulted legal advice and are going to sue<br /> you for £10 million as compensation for wrongful dismissal when you sacked us two<br /> years ago. We would have written sooner but it has taken us this long to recover from<br /> the shock of losing our jobs.<br /> Hope you are keeping well.<br /> Esmeralda<br /> Marvin thinks (incorrectly) that the only protection from this claim is to immediately<br /> form a limited company, so Machiq Partners became Machiq Limited with effect from<br /> 1 July 2014. The company took over all the assets and liabilities of Machiq Partners at<br /> their book values, and had a share capital of 14,000 ordinary shares of £1 each. The<br /> shares, which were issued at a premium, were allocated to Marvin and Chiquita in<br /> the same proportions as their closing capital balances in the partnership. During the<br /> year ended 30 June 2015, Machiq Limited made an operating profit before taxation of<br /> £92,000. Taxation was to be provided on this amount at 20%, and a dividend of £2.25<br /> per share was paid. Nothing further was heard from Esmeralda or her family during the<br /> year, although there were rumours that she had rejoined her former employer, Kaboosh<br /> Limited.</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Required</strong><br /> (b) Show Machiq Limited’s income statement (starting with the operating profit before<br /> taxation) for the year ended 30 June 2015, and the ‘total equity’ section of the statement<br /> of financial position as at that date.</p>
