Power system analysis requires, of course, that the user provide the program with a model of the power system. With PowerWorld, you can either build a new case (model) from scratch or start from an existing case. Most of the examples in the book, as in this case, initially start from an existing case. PowerWorld uses the common ribbon user interface in which common commands, such as opening or saving a case, are available by clicking on the items on the top of the screen. So to open a case click File and then select Open Case. This displays the Open Dialog. Select the Example 1_1 case in the Chapter 1 directory, and then click Open. The display should look similar to Figure 1.6.</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="/imagesdb/uploads/2021/06/1.1-10.png"></div>

For users familiar with electric circuit schematics, it is readily apparent that Figure 1.6 does not look like a traditional schematic. This is because the system is drawn in what is called a oneline diagram form. A brief explanation is in order. Electric power systems range in size from small dc systems with peak power demands of perhaps a few milliwatts (mW) to large continent-spanning interconnected ac systems with peak demands of hundreds of Giga-watts (GW) of demand (1 GW = 1 × <span class="tex-text">\(10^{9} \)</span> Watt). The subject of this book and also PowerWorld are the high-voltage, high-power, interconnected ac systems. Almost without exception these systems operate using three-phase ac power at either 50 or 60 Hz. As discussed in Chapter 2, a full analysis of an arbitrary three-phase system requires consideration of each of the three phases. Drawing such systems in full schematic form quickly gets excessively complicated. Thankfully, during normal operation, three-phase systems are usually balanced. This permits the system to be accurately modeled as an equivalent single-phase system (the details are discussed in Chapter 8, “Symmetrical Components”), Most power system analysis packages, including PowerWorld, use this approach. Then connections between devices are drawn with a single line joining the system devices, hence the term oneline diagram. However, do keep in mind that the actual systems are three-phase.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 1.6 illustrates how the major power system components are represented in PowerWorld. Generators are shown as a circle with a “dog-bone” rotor, large arrows represent loads, and transmission lines are simply drawn as lines. In power system terminology, the nodes at which two or more devices join are called buses. In PowerWorld, thicker lines usually represent buses; the bus voltages are shown in kilovolts (kV) in the fields immediately to the right of the buses. In addition to voltages, power engineers are also concerned with how power flows through the system (the solution of the power flow problem is covered in Chapter 6, “Power Flows”). In PowerWorld, power flows can be visualized with arrows superimposed on the generators, loads, and transmission lines. The size and speed of the arrows indicate the direction of flow. One of the unique aspects of PowerWorld is its ability to animate power systems. To start the animation, select the<strong> Tools </strong>tab on the ribbon and then click on the green and black arrow button above <strong>Solve </strong>(i.e., the “Play” button). The oneline should come to life! While the oneline is being animated, you can interact with the system. Figure 1.6 represents a simple power system in which a generator is supplying power to a load through a 16-kV distribution system feeder. The solid red blocks on the line and load represent circuit breakers. To open a circuit breaker, simply click on it. Since the load is series-connected to the generator, clicking on any of the circuit breakers isolates the load from the generator resulting in a blackout. To restore the system, click again on the circuit breaker to close it and then again select the Solve button on the <strong>Tools </strong>ribbon. To vary the load, click on the up or down arrows between the<br /> load value and its “MW” field. Note that because of the impedance of the line, the load’s voltage drops as its value is increased.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can view additional information about most of the elements on the oneline by right-clicking on them. For example right-clicking on the generator symbol brings up a local menu of additional information about the generator, while rightclicking on the transmission line brings up local menu of information about the line. The meaning of many of these fields become clearer as you progress through the book. To modify the display itself, simply right-click on a blank area of the oneline. This displays the Onelines local menu. Select <strong>Oneline Display Options</strong> to display the Oneline Display Options dialog. From this dialog you can customize many of the display features. For example, to change the animated flow arrow color, select Animated Flows from the options shown on the left side of the dialog.<br /> Then click on the green colored box next to the Actual MW field (towards the bottom of the dialog) to change its color. There are several techniques for panning and/or zooming on the oneline. One method to pan is to first click in an empty portion of the display and then press the keyboard arrow keys in the direction you would like to move. To zoom, just hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the up arrow to zoom in or the down arrow to zoom out. Alternatively you can drag the oneline by clicking and holding the left mouse button down and then moving the mouse—the oneline should follow. To go to a favorite view from the Onelines local menu, select the <strong>Go To View </strong>to view a list of saved views.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you would like to retain your changes after you exit PowerWorld, you need to save the results. To do this, select File in the upper-left portion of the ribbon and then <strong>Save Case As;</strong> enter a different file name so as to not overwrite the initial case. One important note: PowerWorld actually saves the information associated with the power system model itself in a different file from the information associated with the oneline. The power system model is stored in *.pwb files (PowerWorld Binary file) while the Oneline Display information is stored in *.pwd files (PowerWorld Display file). For all the cases discussed in this book, the names of both files should be the same (except the different extensions). The reason for the dual file system is to provide flexibility. With large system models, it is quite common for a system to be displayed using multiple oneline diagrams. Furthermore, a single oneline diagram might be used at different times to display information about different cases.</p>
