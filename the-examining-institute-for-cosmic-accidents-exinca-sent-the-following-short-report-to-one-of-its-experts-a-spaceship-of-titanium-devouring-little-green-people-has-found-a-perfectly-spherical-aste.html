            <p class="blog">The Examining Institute for Cosmic Accidents (EXINCA) sent the following short report to one of its experts:</p> <p class="blog">A spaceship of titanium-devouring little green people has found a perfectly spherical asteroid. A narrow trial shaft was bored from point <span class="tex-text">\( A \)</span> on its surface to the centre <span class="tex-text">\( O \)</span> of the asteroid. This confirmed that the whole asteroid is made of homogeneous titanium. At that point, an accident occurred when one of the little green men fell off the surface of the asteroid into the trial shaft. He fell, without any braking, until he reached <span class="tex-text">\( O, \)</span> where he died on impact. However, work continued and the little green men started secret excavation of the titanium, in the course of which they formed a spherical cavity of diameter <span class="tex-text">\( AO \)</span> inside the asteroid, as illustrated in the figure. Then a second accident occurred- another little green man similarly fell from point <span class="tex-text">\( A \)</span> to point <span class="tex-text">\( O, \)</span> and died.</p> <p class="blog">EXINCA asked the expert to calculate the ratio of the impact speeds and the ratio of the times taken to fall from <span class="tex-text">\( A \)</span> to 0 by the two unfortunate little men.

First consider the trial bore, which is of negligible volume compared with that of the whole asteroid. Let the density of the asteroid be <span class="tex-text">\( \rho \)</span> and its radius <span class="tex-text">\( R.\)</span> The gravitational acceleration at radius <span class="tex-text">\( r \)</span> is the same as if only the sphere of radius <span class="tex-text">\( r \)</span> below it were present:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( g(r)=G\frac{m(r)}{r^2}=G\frac{(4/3)\pi r^3\rho }{r^2}=\frac{4\pi G\rho }{3}r. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
Thus the gravitational acceleration is directly proportional to the distance from the centre of the asteroid and always points towards it.<br /> This means that the first unfortunate little green man approached his fate whilst executing a harmonic oscillation of amplitude <span class="tex-text">\( R, \)</span> and reached it after the first quarter-period of the oscillation. The coefficient of <span class="tex-text">\( r \)</span> in the above expression corresponds to <span class="tex-text">\( w^2, \)</span> i.e. to the square of the angular frequency. Therefore the duration of the fall was</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( T_1=\frac{T}{4}=\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{3\pi }{G\rho } } . \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The speed at which he collided with the bottom of the hole can be obtained as the product of his amplitude and angular frequency,</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( v_1=R \ w=2R\sqrt{\frac{\pi G\rho }{3} }. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
By the time of the second accident, the little green people had already excavated one-eighth of the material in the asteroid. The gravitational field in the spherical cavity, extending from the surface of the planet to its centre, has to be determined. This can be done using a &#8216;cunning&#8217; application of the principle of superposition: imagine the cavity to be filled with a mixture of &#8216;normal&#8217; titanium and &#8216;negative density&#8217; titanium.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The gravitational fields of the complete asteroid and of the sphere of &#8216;negative titanium&#8217; have to be added. The vector r pointing to an arbitrary point <span class="tex-text">\( P \)</span> in the cavity, the vector c pointing from the centre of the cavity to the centre of the asteroid and the vector r + c pointing from the centre of the cavity to point <span class="tex-text">\( P \)</span> are shown in Fig. S110.1.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The gravitational accelerations (of the homogeneous asteroid, of the cavity and of their resultant) are proportional to the position vectors, the coefficient of proportionality being the constant previously denoted by <span class="tex-text">\( -w^2 \)</span>. The &#8216;lack of matter&#8217; in the cavity is represented by a negative density. The resultant acceleration (see Fig. S110.2) is</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( g=-w^2r+w^2(r+c )=w^2c.\)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
This gravitational acceleration is a constant vector, regardless of the position of point <span class="tex-text">\( P \)</span> inside the cavity. This means that there is a homogeneous gravitational field in the cavity, with a magnitude <span class="tex-text">\( -w^2 R/2, \)</span> the gravitational acceleration in the middle of the trial bore (i.e. at the centre of the cavity).</p>
 <p class="blog">
<em>Note</em>. It can similarly be shown that there is a homogeneous field in any spherical cavity; it has a magnitude equal to the gravitational acceleration at the position inside the solid sphere on which the cavity is to be centred.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The duration <span class="tex-text">\( T_2 \)</span> of the fall and the speed of impact <span class="tex-text">\( v_2 \)</span> of the second unfortunate little green man can be calculated by applying the equations for uniform acceleration:</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( T_2=\frac{2}{w}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi G\rho } } \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( v_2=2R\sqrt{\frac{\pi G\rho }{3} } . \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
The ratios reported by the expert were therefore</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-text">\( \frac{T_1}{T_2}=\frac{\pi }{4} \)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\( \frac{v_1}{v_2} =1. \)</span></p>
 <p class="blog">
It can be seen that the second unfortunate little green man took a slightly longer time to fall than the first one, but that they both hit the centre of the asteroid with the same speed.</p>
 <p class="blog">
The fact that the speeds are the same- and, by implication, so are their kinetic energies-is not a coincidence! In the first case, because the gravitational potential is lower at the centre of the asteroid than at its surface, the first unfortunate man is accelerated and gains the corresponding amount of kinetic energy. The second case is different in that the gravitational potential of the &#8216;negative density&#8217; cavity has to be taken into account as well. However, the man fell from one edge of the cavity to the other, and so his gravitational potential with respect to the cavity did not change. Applying the principle<br /> of superposition to the gravitational potentials gives the final result, namely that the total change in the potentials is the same in both cases, and so the speeds acquired by the two victims are the same.</p>
