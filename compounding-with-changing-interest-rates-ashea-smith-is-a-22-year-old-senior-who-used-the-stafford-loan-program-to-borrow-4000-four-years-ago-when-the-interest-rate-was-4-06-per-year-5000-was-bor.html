The following cash-flow diagram clarifies the timing of Ashea’s loans and the applicable interest rates. The diagram is drawn using Ashea’s viewpoint.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Before we can find the annual repayment amount, we need to find the current (time 0) equivalent value of the four loans. This problem can be solved by compounding the amount owed at the beginning of each year by the interest rate that applies to each individual year and repeating this process over the four years to obtain the total current equivalent value.</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(F_{-3} \)</span>=$4,000(F/P,4.06%,1)+$5,000=$4,000(1.0406)+$5,000=</p>
 <p class="blog">
$9,162.40<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{-2}\)</span> = $9,162.40(F/P,3.42%,1)+$6,000=$15,475.75<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{-1}\)</span> = $15,475.75(F/P,5.23%,1)+$7,000=$23,285.13<br /> <span class="tex-text">\(F_{-0}\)</span> = $23,285.13(F/P,6.03%,1)=$24,689.22</p>
 <p class="blog">
Notice that it was a simple matter to substitute</p>
 <p class="blog">
(F/P,i%,N) = <span class="tex-text">\(\left(1+i\right)^{N} \)</span><br /> for the noninteger values of i. Now that we have the current equivalent value of the amount Ashea borrowed<br /> (<span class="tex-text">\(F_{0}\)</span> = <span class="tex-text">\(P_{0}\)</span> ), we can easily compute her annual repayment amount over 20 years when the interest rate is fixed at 5% per year.<br /> A=$24,689.22(A/P, 5%, 20) =$24,689.22(0.0802)=$1,980.08 per year<br /> Comment<br /> The total principal borrowed was $4,000+$5,000+$6,000+$7,000=$22,000.<br /> Notice that a total of $17,601.60 (20×$1,980.08−$22,000) in interest is repaid over the entire 20-year loan period. This interest amount is close to the amount of principal originally borrowed.Moral:Borrow as little as possible and repay as quickly as possible to reduce interest expense!
