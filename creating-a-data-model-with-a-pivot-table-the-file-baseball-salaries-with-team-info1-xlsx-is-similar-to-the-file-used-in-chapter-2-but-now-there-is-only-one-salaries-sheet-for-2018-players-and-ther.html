            <p class="blog"><strong>CREATING A DATA MODEL WITH A PIVOT TABLE</strong></p> <p class="blog">The file Baseball Salaries with Team Info1.xlsx is similar to the file used in Chapter 2, but now there is only one Salaries sheet (for 2018 players), and there is an extra Teams sheet. The tables on the two sheets have been designated as Excel tables, with table names Salary_Table and Team_Table. The Team table has a row for each of the 30 teams, listing the team’s name, the team’s division (such as National East), and the team’s league (American or National). The Salary table has a row for each player, which includes the player’s team, his position, and his salary. In database terms, the Team field is a primary key for the Teams table and a foreign key for the Salaries table. However, these tables are not yet related; they haven’t yet been linked through their key fields. How can you use a pivot table to create a Data Model from the Teams and Salaries tables?</p> <p class="blog"><strong>Objective</strong></p> <p class="blog">To create a Data Model by creating a pivot table from the baseball data and, in the process, to relate the two tables.</p>

The following steps are required. (You can see the results in the Baseball Salaries with Team Info1 Finished.xlsx file.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
1. Open the Baseball Salaries with Team Info1.xlsx file.</p>
 <p class="blog">
2. Select any cell in the Salaries table; select PivotTable on the Insert ribbon; fill out the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 4.11, making sure to check the Data Model option near the bottom; and click OK.</p>
 <p class="blog">
3. As usual, a new sheet with a blank pivot table will open, but something else happens. If you open the Power Pivot window as in , you will see that the table from the Salaries sheet has been added to a new Data Model.</p>
 <p class="blog">
You can start a Data Model by creating a pivot table from existing worksheet data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
4. Back in the pivot table sheet in Excel, drag Salary to the Values area.</p>
 <p class="blog">
5. At this point, the “Active” link at the top of the PivotTable Fields pane is active (boldfaced), and only the fields in the Salary_Table are listed. But now click the “All” link. All fields in both tables are then listed. (See Figure 4.12.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
6. Expand the Team_Table list and check the Division field, the goal being to find the sum of salaries in each of the six divisions. However, because the two tables are not yet related, you will see the warning in yellow in Figure 4.12. Also, the pivot table values will be wrong because Excel is unable to combine data from two tables that aren’t related.</p>
 <p class="blog">
7. To fix the problem, click the Auto-Detect button. In this case, Excel has the intelligence to recognize that the Team fields in the two tables serve as key fields, so it uses them to relate the tables. Nevertheless, it lets you examine the relationship. To do this, click the Manage Relationships button on the resulting dialog box and then click Edit to see the dialog box in Figure 4.13. This has indeed been filled in correctly, and it is exactly how you would fill it in if you clicked the CREATE button instead of the Auto-Detect button in Figure 4.12. The point is that the two tables are now related based on their Team key fields—and the pivot table values are now correct.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If you drag fields from unrelated tables to a pivot table, you will be warned about a missing relationship.</p>
 <p class="blog">
8. To see what else has happened, open the Power Pivot window again. In diagram view, you will see both tables, linked by their key fields. That is, both tables are now part of the workbook’s Data Model. The only difference between this example and the previous Contoso example is that the Data Model has now been created through pivot table operations, not through importing external data.</p>
 <p class="blog">
9. Want a surprise? To be safe, save your work. Then delete the Salaries and Teams sheets. Now manipulate the pivot table any way you like. The pivot table will still work fine! This is because the pivot table’s source is the Data Model, and the original data sheets are no longer necessary.</p>
