            <p class="blog">Your government facility uses an overhead crane to move major pieces of equipment. The current crane has been very reliable since the mid-1980s, but management would like to replace it with a new crane that has modern electronic controls. Your boss has asked you to cost out refurbishing the existing crane or replacing it with a new one. Based on your conversations with several vendors, you came up with the following information:<br /> Refurbish the existing crane:<br /> • Steel repairs and reinforcement: $525,000<br /> • Strip and recoat all exposed surfaces: $480,000<br /> Replace the crane:<br /> • Cost of new crane: $3,689,000 (includes installation)</p>

You know that you must look at this from a total owner cost perspective and must make some assumptions about life cycle, operations and maintenance costs, inflation, and so on. You are mandated by law to use an interest rate of 1.8% when analyzing new construction and capital replacement projects in your state.<br /> 1. List all assumptions related to this project from a TOC<br /> perspective.<br /> The most important assumption is whether the existing crane will last as long as a new crane. Will you have to refurbish or replace the existing one before the new one needs replacing? We are going to assume that both cranes have a life of 30 more years before they require major repairs or replacement. When challenged by management, you should probably state these assumptions to provide validity to your analysis:<br /> • The existing crane, which is very well built, can easily last 30<br /> more years.<br /> • There will be a hidden cost of $50,000 for removing the existing<br /> crane. There is no secondary market for the crane because of its<br /> poor shape, old motors, and so on, beyond scrap metal.</p>
 <p class="blog">
• The annual maintenance cost of the existing crane is about $1,000 per year.<br /> • The power requirements to operate both cranes are the same— about $300/year.<br /> • Assume that, on average, the old crane has to be repaired every 5 years at a cost of $3,000.<br /> • Assume that the new crane will operate for 10 years with no repairs needed and will then require the same maintenance intervals of 5 years with repair costs of $5,000 (more complicated control system).<br /> • The new crane is easier to maintain, and so the annual maintenance costs are about $500/year.<br /> • Assume the following inflation rates: energy=5%, general rate=3%.<br /> 2. Conduct the appropriate analysis to present to management to help in deciding which option to pursue.<br /> Below are the first 10 years of a 30-year spreadsheet. All the items listed are costs, so we simply left everything positive. Note how the appropriate adjustment factors were applied and the NPV was calculated based on 1.8%.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Note how the NPV function is used in Excel in that you cannot include year 0 costs when using the built-in function.<br /> 3. Make a recommendation to management. Over a 30-year life, the new crane will cost roughly $2.7 million more in today’s dollars. All things equal (safety, reliability, etc.), the logical choice is to refurbish the existing crane.</p>
