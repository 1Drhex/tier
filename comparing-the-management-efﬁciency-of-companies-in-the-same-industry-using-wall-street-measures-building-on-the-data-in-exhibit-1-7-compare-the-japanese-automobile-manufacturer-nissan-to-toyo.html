The first step is to get comparable data on Nissan. One website that has this data is http://money.msn.com/. Hyperlink to this site using your browser and then enter NSANY in the “Get Quote” block on the top of the page. Then from the menu on the left under “Fundamentals,” select “Key Ratios,” and finally “Mgmt Efficiency.” Check to see that you have the correct data. The industry comparison column should be the same for all the companies you are comparing. The actual industry description is given on the Fundamentals, Company Report page. Checking this ensures you are making a fair comparison. Comparable data for Nissan is as follows:</p>
 <p class="blog">
Income per employee $4,044<br /> Revenue per employee $607,044<br /> Receivable turnover 2.4<br /> Inventory turnover 7.9<br /> Asset turnover 0.7</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, we need to try to understand the data. It is probably good to start with asset turnover, since this is the most comprehensive measure. Notice that, except for GM, asset turnover is about the same for all four firms, indicating that the revenue generated for the assets employed is comparable across the group. Recall that GM recently went bankrupt and was recapitalized, which could explain the higher asset turnover. Nissan, though, is fine compared to the industry average on this measure</p>
 <p class="blog">
The major difference is in relative efficiency, the cost of generating this revenue. The income (net profit) for Nissan is much lower than that of the other companies and of the industry. There is a major difference in the relative profitability of Nissan compared to the other companies. The very low receivable turnover ratio indicates that Nissan needs to much more quickly convert sales to cash. Much of this may relate to the amount of credit it is giving customers in order to sell vehicles. Financing this debt burden may be costing Nissan. Nissan should study its credit policies to better understand why it is not able to collect from customers. Are there major quality problems with its products? Are the lead times to process these transactions much slower than those of the other companies? It may be just that it is financing many of these purchases, which may be dragging down its profits. The low inventory turnover figure indicates that the supply chain and operations processes need to be improved. This number is a function of the purchasing and raw material processes, the production function, and logistics and distribution. An analysis of details related to the various inventories could be done to pinpoint the problem. Clearly at this time of data collection, Nissan is in a financially more difficult position compared to the other companies.</p>
