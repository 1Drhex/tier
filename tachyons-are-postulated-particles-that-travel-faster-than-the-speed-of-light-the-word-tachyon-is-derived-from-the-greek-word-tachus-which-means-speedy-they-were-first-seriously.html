Let’s first examine Equation (2.65) for energy:</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
<span class="tex-text">\(E=\gamma m c^{2}=\frac{m c^{2}}{\sqrt{1-u^{2} / c^{2}}}\)</span> (2.65)</p>
 <p class="blog">
&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because u &gt; c, the energy must be imaginary if the mass is real, or conversely, if we insist that energy be real, we must have an imaginary mass! For purposes of discussion, we will henceforth assume that energy is real and tachyon mass is imaginary. Remember that ordinary matter must always travel at speed less than c, light must travel at the speed of light, and tachyons must always have speed greater than c. In order to slow down a tachyon, we must give it more energy, according to Equation (2.65). Note that the energy must become infinite if we want to slow down a tachyon to speed c. If the tachyon’s energy is reduced, it speeds up!</p>
 <p class="blog">
Because tachyons travel faster than c, we have a problem with causality. Consider a tachyon leaving Earth at time t = 0 that arrives at a distant galaxy at time T. A spaceship traveling at speed less than c from Earth to the galaxy could conceivably find that the tachyon arrived at the galaxy before it left Earth!</p>
 <p class="blog">
It has been proposed that tachyons might be created in high-energy particle collisions or in cosmic rays. No confirm ing evidence has been found. Tachyons, if charged, could also be detected from Cerenkov radiation. When we refer to speed c, we always mean in a vacuum. When traveling in a medium, the speed must be less than c. When particles have speed greater than light travels in a medium, characteristic electromagnetic radiation is emitted. The effect of the blue glow in swimming pool nuclear reactors is due to this Cerenkov radiation.</p>
