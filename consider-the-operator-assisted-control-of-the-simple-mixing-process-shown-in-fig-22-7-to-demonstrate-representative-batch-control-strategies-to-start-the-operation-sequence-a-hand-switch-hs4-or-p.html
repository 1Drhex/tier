            <p class="blog">Consider the operator-assisted control of the simple mixing process shown in Fig. 22.7 to demonstrate representative batch control strategies. To start the operation sequence, a hand switch (HS4) or push button is activated by the operator, which causes a solenoid valve (VN7) to be opened to introduce liquid A. Liquid transfers are implemented by gravity in this example (no pumps are needed). When the liquid level in the tank reaches an intermediate value (LH2), flow A is stopped and flow B is started (VN8). At the same time, a motor (MN5) is started to turn on the mixer. When the liquid level reaches a specified level (LXH2), flow B is stopped and the discharge valve is opened (VN9). After the tank level reaches the low limit (LL2), the discharge valve is closed and the motor stopped. The operator may now start another mixing cycle by pushing the start button again. It should be noted that this simplified control strategy does not deal with emergency situations. Timing of equipment sequencing, such as making sure that valve VN8 is closed before opening discharge valve VN9, is also not considered. Develop an information flow diagram, a sequential functionchart, and binary and ladder logic diagrams for this batch operation. Assume the batch proceeds uninterrupted (i.e., do not consider the case where the operator could accidentally activate the hand switch after the batch sequence starts).</p> <p class="blog">For the binary logic diagram, denote the tank level by L and use the following binary values for the different device states:</p> <p class="blog">operator push<br /> button HS4: on ⇒1 off ⇒ 0<br /> LH2 indicator: L ≥ LH2 ⇒1 L&lt; LH2 ⇒ 0<br /> LXH2 indicator: L ≥ LXH2 ⇒1 L&lt; LXH2 ⇒ 0<br /> LL2 indicator: L ≥ LL2 ⇒0 L&lt; LL2 ⇒ 1<br /> Valves VN7, VN8,<br /> VN9: open ⇒ 1 closed ⇒ 0<br /> Mixer MN5: motor on ⇒1 off ⇒ 0</p> <div class="image-clearfix"><img class="question-image" src="../imagesdb/uploads/2021/07/22.7.png"></div>

Figures 22.8 and 22.9 show the series of events on the information flow diagram and the sequential function chart. For implementation via hardware (or software) interlocks, the binary logic diagram is shown in Fig. 22.10. Figure 22.6 defines the symbols used in this logic diagram. Gate 1 (an AND gate) ensures that the process will not start, if requested, when the tank level is not low. Gate 3 opens valve VN7 for flow A only if valve VN8 is not open (small circle on gate 3 denotes NOT). Gate 2 (an OR gate) latches the operator request once valve VN7 is opened so that the operator may release the push button. Gates 4 and 7 start flow B and the mixer motor when the intermediate liquid level is reached. This start signal (AND gate 3) terminates flow A. At the high tank liquid level, gate 6 opens the discharge valve. Gate 7 is used to prevent VN8 from opening during the discharge cycle. Gate 8 starts the mixer MN5 at the same time that valve VN8 is opened and ensures that the mixer continues to operate when VN8 is closed and VN9 is opened. The high-level signal LH2 is fed into gate 4 to stop flow B and the mixer motor. Gate 5 holds the discharge signal until the tank is drained.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Figure 22.11 presents the ladder logic diagram for the same mixing process. An example of a normally open contact is C1 (no slash), and an example of a normally closed contact is CR8. The operator-actuated push button HS4 and contact C1 form an AND gate equivalent to gate 1 in Fig. 22.10. The junction connecting rungs 1 and 1a is equivalent to the output of the OR gate 2 in Fig. 22.10. Contact C1 on rung 1 is normally open unless the tank level is low (condition LL2). Contact relay CR8 is usually closed unless relay CR8 on rung 2 is energized. When the level is at (or below) LL2, contact C1 is closed. Then if push button HS4 is engaged, rung 1 becomes energized. Because contact CR8 is normally closed, this action energizes CR7, which results in starting flow A. At the same time, because CR7 is energized, it closes the normally open CR7 on rung 1a. As soon as CR7 on rung 1a is closed, the operator can release HS4, but rung 1/1a will stay energized (or latched) to continue introducing flow A. As long as the level is not at or above LH2, C2 on rung 2 is open. Although CR9 and C3 on rung 2 are closed, rung 2 is not energized because of C2. Thus, contact CR8 remains “not energized,” and the mixer motor and flow B valve are not active.</p>
 <p class="blog">
This all changes when the level reaches LH2. First, C2 on rung 2 closes. Because all three contacts on rung 2 are now closed, rung 2 and CR8 are energized. This activates solenoid valve control VN8. At the same time, as soon as CR8 on rung 2 is energized, it opens CR8 on rung 1 and closes CR8 on rung 3. This deenergizes rungs 1 and 1a and CR7, causing two things to happen. First, CR7 on rung 1a is opened; that is, rungs 1 and 1a are “tripped.” More importantly, because CR7 is deenergized, the solenoid valve for flow A is also deenergized, closing the valve and stopping flow A.</p>
 <p class="blog">
In rung 3, CR5 is energized, turning on the mixer motor control MN5. Rung 3a assures that CR5 remains energized after the contact CR8 is deenergized. The junction connecting rungs 3 and 3a is equivalent to the output of the OR gate 8 in Fig. 22.10. For rung 4, as soon as the liquid level reaches LXH2, C4 closes energizing the discharge solenoid valve VN9. The discharge should not stop until the level drops below LXH2, so rung 4a is designed to latch LXH2 (CR9). This strategy allows discharge to continue until the level reaches LL2 (which is tripped by normally closed contact C5).</p>
