FACT requires the FTC to make it easier for individuals victimized by identity theft to file a theft report and requires credit bureaus to help victims resolve the problems. This should make it easier for customers to handle identity theft problems and may reduce costs to the financial institutions that serve these customers. Financial institutions should be able to spend less on reimbursing customers for theft problems and perhaps the instances of identity theft will also be reduced at the same time.</p>

Check 21 allows financial institutions to send substitute checks to other banks to clear checks rather than the checks themselves. The substitute checks can be electronic images that can be transferred in an instant at a much lower cost to other institutions. This should reduce costs to institutions as they do not have to have an employee physically transfer checks anymore. In addition, financial institutions should know more quickly whether a check is good and this should reduce fraud and other costs associated with bad checks.</p>

Federal Deposit Insurance Reform raises the deposit insurance limits for certain retirement accounts and allows regulators to periodically adjust deposit insurance limits for inflation. This should allow investors to put more money into insured deposit accounts and may allow banks to have a more stable and reliable source of funds for loans and other investments. This will probably have the effect of increasing bank revenues and/or reducing expenses for the bank.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For all of these new laws, the effect should be to make the bank more profitable because of higher revenues or lower expenses. At the same time these new laws allow financial institutions to better serve their customers.</p>
