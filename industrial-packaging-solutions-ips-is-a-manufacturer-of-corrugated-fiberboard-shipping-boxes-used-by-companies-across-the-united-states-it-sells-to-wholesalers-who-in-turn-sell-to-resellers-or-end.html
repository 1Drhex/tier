            <p class="blog">Industrial Packaging Solutions (IPS) is a manufacturer of corrugated fiberboard shipping boxes used by companies across the United States. It sells to wholesalers, who in turn sell to resellers or end-user customers. Final products are consolidated on standard shipping pallets of uniform dimensions and weight. Because of this, the cost to ship a pallet to a single destination is the same regardless of the type of box loaded on the pallet. The standard unit for sales and operations planning at IPS is a pallet load.<br /> After recently opening a new factory to satisfy growing demand for its products, IPS is concerned about allocating demand from its customers to the facilities in its production network. It wants to do so in a way that minimizes the total cost of shipping final products to the wholesalers.<br /> It currently has three factories that service a network of eight major wholesalers. Relevant data for the next year are shown in the following tables.</p>  <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 393px; height: 20px;" border="0" width="128" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.4pt;"> <td style="height: 14.4pt; width: 48pt; text-align: center;" width="64" height="19">Factory Location</td> <td style="width: 48pt; text-align: center;" width="64">Production<br /> Capacity<br /> (pallets × 1,000)</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt;"> <td style="height: 14.4pt;" height="19">Denver, CO</td> <td>25</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt;"> <td style="height: 14.4pt;" height="19">Chicago, IL</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt;"> <td style="height: 14.4pt;" height="19">Baltimore, MD</td> <td>35</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div>

The first step is to consolidate the capacity, demand, and cost data in a single table. This table is shown as follows. Note that the capacity and demand numbers have been converted to single pallets to match the transportation cost units. You could instead convert the transportation cost data into 1,000 pallet units. Either way is fine, as long as you have consistent units for all data.</p>
 <div class="table-overflow"><table  style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 673px;height: 119px" border="0" width="576" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt;width: 48pt" width="64" height="19"></td> <td class="xl65" style="width: 384pt;text-align: center" colspan="9" width="512">Destination City and Transportation Rates</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" height="19">Factory Location</td> <td>Spokane</td> <td>L.A.</td> <td>K.C.</td> <td>Minn.</td> <td>Indy</td> <td>Atlanta</td> <td>N.Y.</td> <td>Orlando</td> <td>Capacity</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" height="19">Denver, CO</td> <td>$42</td> <td>$49</td> <td>$45</td> <td>$54</td> <td>$56</td> <td>$465</td> <td>$70</td> <td>$72</td> <td>25,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" height="19">Chicago, IL</td> <td>$65</td> <td>$69</td> <td>$49</td> <td>$38</td> <td>$32</td> <td>$45</td> <td>$50</td> <td>$55</td> <td>50,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" height="19">Baltimore,MD</td> <td>$75</td> <td>$77</td> <td>$68</td> <td>$62</td> <td>$43</td> <td>$44</td> <td>$35</td> <td>$38</td> <td>35,000</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14.4pt"> <td style="height: 14.4pt" height="19"><strong>Demand:</strong></td> <td>8,500</td> <td>19,600</td> <td>9,300</td> <td>8,800</td> <td>11,800</td> <td>13,600</td> <td>17,200</td> <td colspan="2">8,400</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p class="blog">
The next step is to insert this table in Excel, along with a copy of the table to indicate the candidate solution and a smaller table to calculate the costs based on the candidate solution. The following screen capture from Excel shows how this would be set up. The blank cells in the candidate solution table represent the amount to ship from each factory to each destination—they will be set up as changing cells in Solver. The Demand Met row in that table sums up each column in the table, telling us how much demand is being met in each city by our solution. For example, the formula in cell B14 is SUM(B11:B13). Similarly, the Capacity Used column sums up each row in the table, telling us how much product is shipped from each plant in our solution. For example, the formula in cell J11 is SUM(Bl1:I11). The cells in the Cost Calculations table each multiply the relevant cells from the candidate solution and the cost data tables, telling us how much our candidate solution costs for each factory–customer combination. For example, the formula in B18 is B11*B4. The Total cell simply sums up all the costs in the table.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Next, we need to set up Solver to let it solve the problem for us. This is fairly easy given the structure of the tables. We need to tell Solver the following things:</p>
 <ul> <li>We want to minimize the total cost.</li> <li>It can change the values of the empty cells in the Candidate Solution table.</li> <li>The amount shipped to each customer must match the amount demanded.</li> <li>The amount shipped from each factory must not exceed the capacity of that factory.</li> </ul> <p class="blog">
After starting Solver, we would set up the parameters as shown. Be sure to set the options to “Assume Linear Model” and “Assume Non-Negative.” (The latter could also be accomplished by adding a constraint that all changing cells be greater than or equal to zero.)</p>
 <p class="blog">
After running Solver, we get the following solution:</p>
 <p class="blog">
If IPS follows the plan presented by Solver, it will spend a little over $4 million to ship its products to its customers next year. The recommended plan should not be too surprisin — Denver primarily satisfies the West Cost demand, Chicago serves the middle of the country, and Baltimore serves the East. This makes sense given the reality that transportation costs increase as distance traveled increases. Further, we can see that both Denver and Baltimore will max out their capacity in this plan, with Chicago using only about 75 percent of capacity.</p>
