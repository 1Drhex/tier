Influence line for reactionR1 In this case we need to eliminate a constraint, where the vertical reaction <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span> arises and apply the positive reaction <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span>. Elastic curve due to unit reaction <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span> in the new system is a model of influence line for <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span>. If load P = 1 is located above support 1, then reaction <span class="tex-text">\(R_1 = 1\)</span>, therefore ordinate of influence line at this support equals to 1. If load is located on portions 1-2 and 3-4, then ordinates of influence lines for <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span> are positive, i.e., the vertical reaction <span class="tex-text">\(R_1\)</span> is directed upward.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Inﬂuence line for bending moment at the support <span class="tex-text">\(M_3\)</span> In this case we need to include the hinge at the support 3, to apply two positive unit couples <span class="tex-text">\(M_3\)</span>, and show the corresponding elastic curve which is a model of required inﬂuence line. If a load is located within portions 2-3 and 3-4, then ordinates of inﬂuence line are negative, i.e., the extended ﬁbers at the support 3 is located above the longitudinal axis of the beam.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Influence line for bending moment Mk in the span. In this case we need to include the hinge at the section k, to apply two positive couples <span class="tex-text">\(M_k\)</span> and show the elastic curve; for this curve a mutual angle of rotation at section k is equal to unity (see Sect. 10.1.1). The positive ordinates of influence line show that extended fibers at the section k are located under of neutral axis of the beam.</p>
 <p class="blog">
For each span we can determine two specific points is called the left and right foci points. They are labeled as <span class="tex-text">\(F ^{left}\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F^{ right}\)</span>. Figure 10.19 presents these points for span 3-4 only. Formulas for computation of location <span class="tex-text">\(F ^L\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F ^R\)</span> are presented<br /> in Appendix, Section A. Foci Points.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Influence lines for bending moment at the span may be of three different shapes depending on where section is located, i.e., between two foci points, between support and focus, and for section which coincides with focus.</p>
 <p class="blog">
If the section k is located between two foci <span class="tex-text">\(F ^L\)</span> and <span class="tex-text">\(F^ R\)</span>, then ordinates of influence line within corresponding span are positive. If a section n is located between left support and focus <span class="tex-text">\(F^L\)</span>, then ordinates of influence line within the corresponding span are positive and negative (influence line for <span class="tex-text">\(M_n\)</span>). The same conclusion will be done if the section is located between <span class="tex-text">\(F^ R\)</span> and right support. If the section under consideration coincides with <span class="tex-text">\(F^ R\)</span> then bending moment does not arise in the section <span class="tex-text">\(F^ R\)</span>, when load P is located in the first and second spans (influence line for <span class="tex-text">\(M_F^R\)</span>). Therefore, for construction of the model of influence line for bending moment at the any section within the span it is necessary first of all, to find location of foci points for given span and then to define which case takes place.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Influence line for shear force <span class="tex-text">\(Q_k\)</span>. In this case we need to eliminate the constraint, which corresponds to the shear force at the section k and apply two positive shears <span class="tex-text">\(Q_k\)</span>. Elastic curve in the new system due to forces <span class="tex-text">\(Q_k = 1\)</span> is a model of influence line for <span class="tex-text">\(Q_k\)</span>. Shape of influence line for shear forces at the sections, which are infinitely closed to the support, may be obtained as limiting cases, when the section is located within the span.</p>
 <p class="blog">
It is obvious that the construction of influence lines for statically determinate multispan beams (Ch. 3) using interaction scheme reflects the M¨uller–Breslau principle.</p>
 <p class="blog">
Summary</p>
 <p class="blog">
The purpose of influence lines and their application for statically determinate structures in case of the fixed and moving load have been discussed in Chaps. 2–4. Of course, this remains also for statically indeterminate structures. However, in case of the statically indeterminate structures, the importance of influence lines and their convenience are sharply increased. Although the construction of influence lines for statically indeterminate structures is not as simple as for statically determinate ones, the consumption of a time is paid off by their advantages. Additional and very important advantage of influence lines is as follows: Influence lines for primary unknown and any factor (reaction, bending moment, the angle of rotation, etc.) for statically indeterminate structure allows calculating not only these unknown and corresponding factor, but also finding a distribution of internal forces for any types of fixed loads. It may be done combining the fixed and moving load approaches. It is a principal feature of influence lines for statically indeterminate structures. Ability of an engineer to apply both methods separately and together increases his opportunity of analysis and allows performing in-depth qualities and quantities investigation of structural behavior.</p>
